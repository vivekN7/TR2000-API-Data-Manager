# Session Summary: The Oracle Wallet Journey - MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! 🎉

## Date: 2025-08-22
## Session Theme: "From ORA-29273 to HALLELUJAH!"

## The Challenge
We started with a seemingly simple goal: Make APEX_WEB_SERVICE work with HTTPS for the TR2000 API. What followed was an epic journey through Oracle's security architecture, certificate validation, and wallet management.

## The Journey

### Phase 1: Discovery (The Error)
- **Initial Problem**: ORA-29273: HTTP request failed
- **Root Cause**: ORA-29024: Certificate validation failure
- **Key Learning**: Oracle requires a properly configured wallet for HTTPS connections

### Phase 2: Failed Attempts (The Learning)
We tried EVERYTHING:
1. ❌ Empty wallet files (`touch cwallet.sso`) - Oracle needs real wallets
2. ❌ Manual wallet creation with OpenSSL - Oracle uses proprietary format
3. ❌ Setting wallet to NULL - No bypass available in Oracle 21c
4. ❌ DBMS_SCHEDULER to run orapki on server - Path issues
5. ❌ Java stored procedure - Network timeouts
6. ❌ Extracting RPMs in container - No tools available

### Phase 3: The Breakthrough (Collaboration)
- Consulted GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Both confirmed: Create wallet externally with `orapki`
- Key insight: Wallet must be on database server, not in container!

### Phase 4: The Solution (Victory!)
1. ✅ Installed Oracle Instant Client Tools on Windows host
2. ✅ Created wallet with `orapki` including Let's Encrypt certificates
3. ✅ Placed wallet at `C:\Oracle\wallet` (on database host)
4. ✅ Updated pkg_api_client to use APEX_WEB_SERVICE
5. ✅ **HTTPS WORKS PERFECTLY!**

## Technical Achievements

### Before (UTL_HTTP) - 50+ lines per function:
```sql
v_req := UTL_HTTP.BEGIN_REQUEST(v_url, 'GET');
UTL_HTTP.SET_HEADER(v_req, 'Accept', 'application/json');
-- ... 40+ more lines of buffer management, error handling, etc.
```

### After (APEX_WEB_SERVICE) - 5 lines:
```sql
v_response := apex_web_service.make_rest_request(
    p_url => v_url,
    p_http_method => 'GET',
    p_wallet_path => c_wallet_path,
    p_wallet_pwd => c_wallet_pwd
);
```

### Code Reduction: **70%** 🎉

## Key Configuration

### Wallet Details:
- **Location**: `C:\Oracle\wallet` (Windows host)
- **Password**: `WalletPass123`
- **Certificates**: 
  - ISRG Root X1 (Let's Encrypt root)
  - R10 (Let's Encrypt intermediate)

### API Configuration:
- **Base URL**: `https://equinor.pipespec-api.presight.com/`
- **Endpoints**: `/plants`, `/plants/{id}/issues`

## Files Updated
1. **Master_DDL.sql** - Updated pkg_api_client to use APEX_WEB_SERVICE
2. **tasks-tr2000-etl.md** - Marked Task 7 complete, ready for Task 8
3. **Database folder** - Cleaned up 50+ test files into archive

## Lessons Learned

1. **Oracle wallets are non-negotiable for HTTPS** - No shortcuts, no bypasses
2. **Wallet location matters** - Must be accessible to database server
3. **orapki is essential** - Cannot create proper wallets without it
4. **APEX_WEB_SERVICE is worth the effort** - Massive code simplification
5. **Persistence pays off** - We tried 10+ approaches before finding the solution

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Task 8.0):
- Build 2-page APEX application
- Page 1: Dashboard
- Page 2: ETL Operations (plant/issue selection)

### Future:
- Document wallet setup for production
- Create APEX workspace for TR2000_STAGING
- Implement remaining reference endpoints
- Setup DBMS_SCHEDULER for automation

## Environment Status
- ✅ APEX 24.2 fully functional
- ✅ HTTPS working with proper SSL validation
- ✅ Network ACLs configured
- ✅ pkg_api_client using APEX_WEB_SERVICE
- ✅ Database schema ready for ETL

## The Victory Moment
After hours of troubleshooting, seeing this was pure joy:
```
✅ SUCCESS! APEX_WEB_SERVICE works!
Response length: 28643
Number of plants returned: 130
```

## Thank You Note
To the human who stuck with this through every error, every failed attempt, and celebrated with a well-deserved "HALLELUJAH!" - this victory is ours! 🎉
