# Oracle APEX_WEB_SERVICE HTTPS Issue - Detailed Technical Report

## Executive Summary
We cannot use APEX_WEB_SERVICE or UTL_HTTP to make HTTPS calls to the TR2000 API due to Oracle's requirement for a properly configured wallet containing SSL certificates. The wallet creation tool (`orapki`) is not available in our Docker container environment.

## Environment Details
- **Database**: Oracle Database 21c Express Edition (21.3.0.0.0)
- **Container**: Running in Docker/WSL on Windows 11
- **Oracle Client**: Instant Client 21.12 (minimal installation)
- **APEX Version**: 24.2.0 (fully installed, 315 WWV_FLOW tables present)
- **Target API**: https://equinor.pipespec-api.presight.com/plants
- **API Certificate**: Let's Encrypt (valid, publicly trusted)

## The Core Problem

### What Works ✅
- APEX_WEB_SERVICE works perfectly with HTTP endpoints
- Network ACLs are properly configured
- APEX installation is complete and valid
- The TR2000 API is accessible via HTTPS from curl
- Database connectivity is working

### What Fails ❌
```sql
-- This fails with ORA-29024: Certificate validation failure
v_response := apex_web_service.make_rest_request(
    p_url => 'https://equinor.pipespec-api.presight.com/plants',
    p_http_method => 'GET'
);
```

**Error Details**:
- Initial error: `ORA-29273: HTTP request failed`
- Root cause: `ORA-29024: Certificate validation failure`
- Applies to both APEX_WEB_SERVICE and UTL_HTTP

## Why This Happens

Oracle Database requires an **Oracle Wallet** to validate SSL certificates for HTTPS connections. A wallet is a secure container that stores:
- Trusted root certificates
- Intermediate certificates  
- Client certificates (if needed)

Without a properly configured wallet, Oracle cannot validate the SSL certificate chain and refuses the connection.

## What We've Tried

### 1. Creating Empty Wallet Files ❌
```bash
touch cwallet.sso ewallet.p12
```
**Result**: Oracle doesn't recognize these as valid wallets

### 2. Manual Wallet Creation with OpenSSL ❌
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -nokeys -in cert_chain.pem -out ewallet.p12
```
**Result**: Created valid PKCS#12 file, but Oracle requires proprietary wallet format

### 3. Setting Wallet to NULL ❌
```sql
UTL_HTTP.SET_WALLET(NULL);
```
**Result**: Still fails with certificate validation error

### 4. Database Server Wallet Creation via DBMS_SCHEDULER ❌
Attempted to run `orapki` on the database server directly
**Result**: Job failed - orapki may not be in expected location

### 5. Java Stored Procedure to Bypass SSL ❌
Created Java function to ignore SSL validation
**Result**: Network timeout - likely blocked by database security

### 6. Downloading Oracle Admin Client ❌
Downloaded RPM packages but cannot extract without rpm2cpio tools
**Result**: Unable to access orapki binary

## The Fundamental Issue

**Oracle Wallets can ONLY be created with Oracle's proprietary `orapki` tool**, which is included in:
- ✅ Full Oracle Database installation
- ✅ Oracle Database Administrator Client  
- ❌ Oracle Instant Client (what we have)
- ❌ Oracle Instant Client Tools Package

Our Docker container only has the Instant Client, which doesn't include `orapki`.

## Technical Constraints

1. **Container Limitations**:
   - Cannot install packages (no apt-get/yum access)
   - Cannot run Docker inside Docker
   - Cannot extract RPM files without proper tools

2. **Oracle Security Model**:
   - No bypass for certificate validation in Oracle 21c
   - Wallet format is proprietary
   - Auto-certificate download feature not working

3. **API Constraints**:
   - API only supports HTTPS (HTTP redirects to HTTPS)
   - Uses Let's Encrypt certificates (publicly trusted)

## Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Install Oracle Admin Client on Database Server
**Requirements**: Access to database server, ability to install software
**Effort**: Medium
**Success Rate**: 100%

### Option 2: Create Wallet on Another Machine
**Process**: Install Oracle client elsewhere, create wallet, copy to container
**Effort**: Low
**Success Rate**: 100%

### Option 3: Reverse Proxy Solution
**Setup**: nginx/Apache proxy to convert HTTPS→HTTP
**Pros**: Works immediately, no Oracle changes needed
**Cons**: Additional infrastructure component

### Option 4: Move API Calls to Application Layer
**Change**: Application makes HTTPS calls, inserts to database
**Pros**: Clean architecture, no wallet needed
**Cons**: Major architectural change

## Code Impact

If we get HTTPS working with APEX_WEB_SERVICE, the code becomes much simpler:

**Current (UTL_HTTP)** - 50+ lines:
```sql
v_req := UTL_HTTP.BEGIN_REQUEST(v_url, 'GET');
UTL_HTTP.SET_HEADER(v_req, 'Accept', 'application/json');
-- ... many more lines of error handling, reading response, etc.
```

**Target (APEX_WEB_SERVICE)** - 3 lines:
```sql
RETURN apex_web_service.make_rest_request(
    p_url => v_url,
    p_http_method => 'GET'
);
```

## Critical Information for Other LLMs

1. **Version Info**: Oracle 21c with APEX 24.2
2. **Error Code**: ORA-29024 (Certificate validation failure)
3. **Missing Tool**: `orapki` not available in instant client
4. **Working Test**: HTTP works, only HTTPS fails
5. **Certificate**: Valid Let's Encrypt certificate
6. **Container**: Cannot install additional software
7. **Wallet Locations Tried**:
   - `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/instantclient_21_12/network/admin/wallet`
   - `/opt/oracle/admin/wallet` (doesn't exist)

## Questions for Investigation

1. Is there a way to create Oracle wallets without `orapki`?
2. Can Oracle 21c be configured to trust system certificates?
3. Is there a hidden parameter to disable SSL validation?
4. Can we use the database's Java VM differently to handle HTTPS?
5. Are there any Oracle patches that relax SSL requirements?

## Immediate Next Steps

Without `orapki`, we need to either:
1. Get access to `orapki` tool somehow
2. Implement a workaround (proxy, application layer)
3. Accept using HTTP in development (if API allows)

## Additional Context for LLMs

### Current Working Directory Structure
```
/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/
├── instantclient_21_12/
│   ├── network/
│   │   └── admin/
│   │       ├── README
│   │       └── wallet/ (created but not working)
│   ├── sqlplus (working)
│   └── [other instant client files]
├── Master_DDL.sql (contains pkg_api_client with UTL_HTTP)
└── [various test scripts]
```

### Specific Error When Testing
```sql
SQL> exec v_resp := apex_web_service.make_rest_request('https://...', 'GET');
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-29273: HTTP request failed
ORA-06512: at "APEX_240200.WWV_FLOW_WEB_SERVICES", line 1182
ORA-29024: Certificate validation failure
ORA-06512: at "SYS.UTL_HTTP", line 380
```

### What Would Success Look Like
- APEX_WEB_SERVICE successfully fetches from HTTPS endpoints
- No need for complex UTL_HTTP code
- Automatic JSON parsing
- Built-in error handling
- 80% code reduction in pkg_api_client
