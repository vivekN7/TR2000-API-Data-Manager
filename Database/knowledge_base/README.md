  - Issues requiring team decisions
  - Architectural considerations
  - Risk assessments
  - Meeting agenda items

## Quick Reference

### Critical Issues to Monitor
1. **Plant ID Changes** - System cannot detect if API changes a plant_id
2. **Network ACL** - Most common cause of API failures
3. **Wallet Configuration** - Required for HTTPS calls

### Key Design Patterns
- **Soft Delete**: Records marked `is_valid='N'` instead of DELETE
- **SHA256 Deduplication**: Skip processing if API response unchanged
- **Three-Layer Architecture**: RAW_JSON â†’ STG_* â†’ Production tables

### Important Queries
```sql
-- Active plants only
SELECT * FROM PLANTS WHERE is_valid = 'Y';

-- Check ETL history
SELECT * FROM ETL_RUN_LOG ORDER BY start_time DESC;

-- Find potential plant ID changes
SELECT old.plant_id as old_id, new.plant_id as new_id, old.short_description
FROM PLANTS old
JOIN PLANTS new ON old.short_description = new.short_description
WHERE old.is_valid = 'N' AND new.is_valid = 'Y'
  AND old.plant_id != new.plant_id;
```
