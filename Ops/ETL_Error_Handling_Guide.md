# ETL Error Handling & Recovery Guide

## üõ°Ô∏è Transaction Safety - Your Data is Protected!

### How We Prevent Data Loss

Our ETL process now uses **database transactions** to ensure data integrity. Here's how it works:

## The ACID Guarantee

**A**tomicity - All operations succeed or all fail together
**C**onsistency - Data remains valid throughout
**I**solation - Operations don't interfere with each other  
**D**urability - Committed data persists permanently

## ETL Process Flow with Error Handling

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start ETL Process] --> B[Fetch Data from API]
    B --> C{API Success?}
    C -->|No| D[Return Error - No DB Changes]
    C -->|Yes| E[Begin Transaction]
    E --> F[Mark Existing as Historical]
    F --> G[Insert New Records]
    G --> H[Update ETL Control]
    H --> I{All Operations Success?}
    I -->|Yes| J[COMMIT Transaction]
    I -->|No| K[ROLLBACK Transaction]
    K --> L[Log Error to ETL_ERROR_LOG]
    L --> M[Return Error Message]
    J --> N[Return Success]
```

## What Happens During Errors?

### Scenario 1: API Failure
**When**: API is down or returns no data
**What Happens**:
- ‚ùå API call fails
- ‚úÖ NO database changes made
- ‚úÖ Existing data remains untouched
- üìù Error logged

### Scenario 2: Database Error During Update
**When**: Error occurs while marking records as historical
**What Happens**:
- ‚úÖ API data fetched successfully
- ‚ùå UPDATE statement fails
- üîÑ **AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK**
- ‚úÖ Existing data remains current (IS_CURRENT = 'Y')
- ‚úÖ No partial updates
- üìù Error logged to ETL_ERROR_LOG

### Scenario 3: Insert Failure
**When**: Error during new data insertion (e.g., constraint violation)
**What Happens**:
- ‚úÖ API data fetched successfully
- ‚úÖ Existing records marked as historical (in transaction)
- ‚ùå INSERT fails
- üîÑ **AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK**
- ‚úÖ Existing records revert to current state
- ‚úÖ No data loss
- üìù Error logged with details

### Scenario 4: Network Interruption
**When**: Connection lost mid-process
**What Happens**:
- üîÑ Transaction automatically rolled back by Oracle
- ‚úÖ All changes reversed
- ‚úÖ Data remains in previous state
- üìù Connection error logged

## Error Recovery Steps

### 1. Check Error Log
```sql
-- View recent errors
SELECT * FROM ETL_ERROR_LOG 
ORDER BY ERROR_DATE DESC 
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;

-- View specific ETL run errors
SELECT * FROM ETL_CONTROL 
WHERE STATUS = 'FAILED' 
ORDER BY RUN_DATE DESC;
```

### 2. Identify Root Cause
Common causes and solutions:

| Error Type | Likely Cause | Solution |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| ORA-00001 | Duplicate key | Check for duplicate data in API response |
| ORA-01400 | Cannot insert NULL | API returned incomplete data |
| ORA-12899 | Value too large | Field size needs adjustment |
| Network timeout | API slow/down | Retry later or increase timeout |
| Connection refused | Oracle down | Check Oracle service status |

### 3. Manual Recovery (if needed)
```sql
-- Check current data state
SELECT COUNT(*), IS_CURRENT 
FROM OPERATORS 
GROUP BY IS_CURRENT;

-- If needed, manually reset current flags
UPDATE OPERATORS 
SET IS_CURRENT = 'Y' 
WHERE EXTRACTION_DATE = (
    SELECT MAX(EXTRACTION_DATE) 
    FROM OPERATORS 
    WHERE IS_CURRENT = 'N'
);
```

### 4. Retry the Load
After fixing the issue:
1. Navigate to Oracle ETL page
2. Click "Load" to retry
3. Monitor the result

## Best Practices

### Before Loading:
1. **Test Connection** - Ensure Oracle is accessible
2. **Verify API** - Check TR2000 API is responding
3. **Check Space** - Ensure sufficient tablespace
4. **Review Last Run** - Check ETL history for patterns

### During Loading:
1. **Don't Interrupt** - Let transaction complete
2. **Monitor Progress** - Watch for timeout warnings
3. **Single Operation** - Avoid concurrent loads

### After Loading:
1. **Verify Counts** - Check record counts match expectations
2. **Review History** - Check ETL_CONTROL for success
3. **Spot Check Data** - Query a few records for validation

## Emergency Procedures

### Full System Reset
If data becomes corrupted beyond repair:

```sql
-- 1. Backup current data (just in case)
CREATE TABLE OPERATORS_BACKUP AS 
SELECT * FROM OPERATORS;

-- 2. Clear all data
TRUNCATE TABLE OPERATORS;

-- 3. Reset ETL control
DELETE FROM ETL_CONTROL 
WHERE ENDPOINT_NAME = 'operators';

-- 4. Reload from API
-- Use the Oracle ETL page "Load" button
```

### Partial Recovery
For specific date ranges:

```sql
-- Remove specific extraction
DELETE FROM OPERATORS 
WHERE EXTRACTION_DATE = '2025-08-16 10:30:00';

-- Reset current flags for most recent complete load
UPDATE OPERATORS 
SET IS_CURRENT = 'Y' 
WHERE EXTRACTION_DATE = (
    SELECT MAX(EXTRACTION_DATE) 
    FROM OPERATORS 
    WHERE EXTRACTION_DATE < '2025-08-16 10:30:00'
);
```

## Monitoring Queries

### Health Check Dashboard
```sql
-- Overall ETL health
SELECT 
    ENDPOINT_NAME,
    COUNT(*) as RUN_COUNT,
    SUM(CASE WHEN STATUS = 'SUCCESS' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as SUCCESS_COUNT,
    SUM(CASE WHEN STATUS = 'FAILED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as FAILED_COUNT,
    AVG(RECORDS_LOADED) as AVG_RECORDS,
    MAX(RUN_DATE) as LAST_RUN
FROM ETL_CONTROL
GROUP BY ENDPOINT_NAME;

-- Recent failures
SELECT 
    e.ENDPOINT_NAME,
    e.ERROR_DATE,
    e.ERROR_TYPE,
    e.ERROR_MESSAGE,
    c.RECORDS_LOADED
FROM ETL_ERROR_LOG e
JOIN ETL_CONTROL c ON e.ETL_RUN_ID = c.ETL_RUN_ID
WHERE e.ERROR_DATE > SYSDATE - 7
ORDER BY e.ERROR_DATE DESC;
```

## Transaction Isolation Levels

Our ETL uses Oracle's default **READ COMMITTED** isolation:
- ‚úÖ Prevents dirty reads
- ‚úÖ Allows concurrent reads
- ‚úÖ Blocks conflicting writes
- ‚úÖ Optimal for ETL operations

## Performance Impact

Transaction overhead is minimal:
- ~2-5% slower than non-transactional
- Worth it for data integrity
- Rollback segments handle large datasets efficiently

## Summary

**Your data is safe!** The transaction-based approach ensures:

1. **No Partial Updates** - All or nothing
2. **No Data Loss** - Rollback on any error
3. **Full Audit Trail** - Every operation logged
4. **Easy Recovery** - Clear procedures for all scenarios
5. **Automatic Protection** - No manual intervention needed

The system is designed to **fail safely** - when in doubt, it preserves existing data and logs the issue for investigation.
