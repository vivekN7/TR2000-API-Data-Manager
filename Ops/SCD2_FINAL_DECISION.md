# TR2000 SCD2 Implementation - Final Decision Document

## Executive Summary
After extensive analysis and consultation, we have reached consensus on a production-ready SCD2 implementation that is:
- **Oracle-centric** - All business logic lives in the database
- **Complete** - Handles 100% of data change scenarios with complete field coverage
- **Optimized** - Uses set-based operations, no loops
- **Maintainable** - Clear separation of concerns, testable
- **Enhanced** - Complete TR2000 API field coverage (Session 20 breakthrough)

## üöÄ Session 20-21 Enhancement: Complete Field Coverage & User Guide
**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH:** Discovered and addressed 80% field coverage gap in original implementation, then updated all user documentation to reflect enhanced capabilities.

### Enhanced Implementation Features:
- **Complete API Field Coverage:** All 24+ PLANTS fields, 25+ ISSUES fields
- **Enhanced Reference Tables:** RevDate, Status, and complete metadata for all reference types
- **New PCS Detail Tables:** 4 specialized tables with 100+ engineering fields
- **Engineering Data:** Design pressures, temperatures, materials, complete specifications
- **Master DDL:** Single source of truth with complete field coverage (Master_DDL_Script.sql)
- **User Documentation:** ‚úÖ Updated in Session 21 - All pages reflect enhanced DDL vs. minimal implementation

## Architecture Philosophy

### C# Responsibilities (Minimal)
1. Fetch data from API
2. Insert into staging tables or RAW_JSON
3. Call Oracle stored procedures
4. Return status to UI

### Oracle Responsibilities (Everything Else)
1. Deduplication
2. Validation
3. SCD2 temporal logic
4. Error handling
5. Audit logging
6. Reconciliation
7. Data transformations
8. Deletion cascade based on ETL_PLANT_LOADER scope

## Core Components

### 1. **Staging Tables with Proper Structure**
```sql
-- All staging tables include:
STG_ID NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY  -- For deterministic dedup
IS_DUPLICATE CHAR(1) DEFAULT 'N'                -- Dedup flag
IS_VALID CHAR(1) DEFAULT 'Y'                    -- Validation flag
VALIDATION_ERROR VARCHAR2(500)                  -- Error details
ETL_RUN_ID NUMBER                               -- Batch tracking
```

### 2. **SCD2 Dimension Tables**
```sql
-- All dimension tables include:
VALID_FROM DATE                  -- When record became active
VALID_TO DATE                     -- When record became inactive
IS_CURRENT CHAR(1)               -- Quick current record lookup
CHANGE_TYPE VARCHAR2(20)         -- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/REACTIVATE
DELETE_DATE DATE                 -- When deleted from source
SRC_HASH RAW(32)                -- Oracle STANDARD_HASH for change detection
ETL_RUN_ID NUMBER                -- Audit trail
```

### 3. **Master Orchestrator Pattern**
```sql
SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SP_DEDUPLICATE_STAGING      -- Remove duplicates
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PKG_*_ETL.VALIDATE          -- Business rules
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PKG_*_ETL.PROCESS_SCD2      -- Temporal logic
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PKG_*_ETL.RECONCILE         -- Count verification
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ COMMIT (single, atomic)     -- All or nothing
```

## Key Design Decisions

### ‚úÖ **INCLUDED Features**

1. **Deduplication via ROW_NUMBER()**
   - Deterministic using STG_ID identity column
   - Handles duplicates from API gracefully

2. **Complete SCD2 Coverage**
   - INSERT: New records
   - UPDATE: Changed records (new version created)
   - DELETE: Soft delete when missing from source
   - REACTIVATE: Deleted records that return

3. **Minimal RAW_JSON Layer** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
   - SecureFiles compression (60-80% reduction)
   - 30-day retention with auto-purge (no DBA required!)
   - Best-effort inserts (failures don't break ETL)
   - Cleanup runs after each ETL (not scheduled job)

4. **RBAC Security**
   - Role-based access control
   - Optional triggers on critical tables
   - No manual DML allowed

5. **Atomic Transactions**
   - Single COMMIT in orchestrator
   - Autonomous transactions for error logging
   - Errors always logged even on rollback

6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Set-based operations only
   - Partial indexes on IS_CURRENT
   - Bulk operations from C#

### ‚ùå **EXCLUDED (Overengineering)**

1. **Complex Crosswalk Tables** - Keys are stable enough
2. **Full JSON Parsing Every Time** - Direct mapping works
3. **ILM Policies** - Simple DELETE job sufficient
4. **Separate REJECT Tables** - ETL_ERROR_LOG handles this
5. **Row-by-Row Processing** - Always use set-based

## Deletion Cascade Pattern (Session 14 Addition)

### ETL_PLANT_LOADER as Single Source of Truth
The ETL_PLANT_LOADER table defines the scope of all ETL operations. Plants in this table are considered "active" and their data is processed. When a plant is removed from the loader:

1. **Issues Deletion Cascade**: All issues for removed plants are marked as deleted
2. **Downstream Impact**: Reference tables only process issues with IS_CURRENT='Y'
3. **Reactivation**: Adding a plant back to the loader will reactivate its issues

### Implementation in PKG_ISSUES_ETL
```sql
-- Step 1: Mark issues deleted for plants NOT in loader
UPDATE ISSUES 
SET IS_CURRENT = 'N', DELETE_DATE = SYSDATE, CHANGE_TYPE = 'DELETE'
WHERE IS_CURRENT = 'Y'
AND PLANT_ID NOT IN (SELECT PLANT_ID FROM ETL_PLANT_LOADER)

-- Step 2: Process issues for plants IN loader (existing logic)
```

### Benefits
- **Clean Scope Control**: ETL_PLANT_LOADER defines what's in scope
- **No Orphaned Data**: Removed plants don't cause unnecessary API calls
- **Full History**: All changes tracked with SCD2
- **Reversible**: Plants can be added back, issues reactivated

## Performance Expectations

With TR2000's data volumes:
- **Operators**: < 1 second (~10 records)
- **Plants**: < 2 seconds (~130 records)
- **Issues**: < 10 seconds (~500 records)
- **Total ETL**: < 30 seconds for all entities

API calls dominate (95% of time), not database operations (5%).

2. **Corruption**: Self-healing via hash comparison
3. **Duplicates**: Handled via ROW_NUMBER() dedup
4. **Manual Changes**: Blocked via RBAC/triggers
5. **Failed ETL**: Atomic rollback, errors logged
