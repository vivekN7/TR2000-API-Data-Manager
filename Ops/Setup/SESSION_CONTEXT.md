# Session Context - TR2000 ETL Implementation

## Current Session Date: 2025-08-22

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Database Schema (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created Master_DDL.sql with complete schema including:
  - RAW_JSON table with SHA256 deduplication
  - STG_PLANTS and STG_ISSUES staging tables
  - PLANTS and ISSUES core tables with is_valid soft delete
  - SELECTION_LOADER for user selections
  - ETL control and monitoring tables
  - DROP statements for clean redeployment

### 2. Stored Procedures (90% COMPLETE)
Created all required packages in Master_DDL.sql:
- ✅ pkg_raw_ingest - Deduplication and RAW_JSON insertion
- ✅ pkg_parse_plants - JSON parsing for plants using JSON_TABLE
- ✅ pkg_upsert_plants - MERGE logic with is_valid management
- ✅ pkg_parse_issues - JSON parsing with dynamic SQL (due to variable path)
- ✅ pkg_upsert_issues - MERGE logic with cascade delete
- ⚠️ pkg_etl_operations - Main orchestration (has minor compilation error)

**Remaining Issue**: pkg_etl_operations has compilation error on lines 48, 53, 115, 120
- Error: ORA-00984: column not allowed here
- Related to EXTRACT function usage in UPDATE statements
- Need to fix duration calculation in next session

### 3. ETL Operations Page (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created unified ETLOperations.razor with 4 tabs
- ✅ Plant selection from API (currently direct, needs to change to DB)
- ✅ Issue selection based on selected plants
- ✅ Selection persistence to SELECTION_LOADER
- ✅ Fixed JSON deserialization for API responses

### 4. Services (COMPLETED)
- ✅ SelectionService.cs - Full CRUD for SELECTION_LOADER
- ✅ ETLService.cs - Basic structure (needs update to call procedures)
- ✅ ETLModels.cs - All data models defined

## Critical Architecture Decision

**Option B Selected**: Proper ETL Architecture
- UI reads from database (PLANTS/ISSUES tables)
- ETL flow: API → RAW_JSON → Staging → Core
- All business logic in Oracle procedures
- C# only orchestrates API calls and procedure execution

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### Immediate Tasks for Next Session:

1. **Fix pkg_etl_operations compilation error**
   - The EXTRACT function in UPDATE statements needs fixing
   - Lines 48, 53, 115, 120 have "column not allowed here" errors

2. **Update ETLService.cs**
   - Implement CallStoredProcedure method to actually call Oracle procedures
   - Add proper transaction handling
   - Implement insert to RAW_JSON before calling procedures

3. **Modify UI to Read from Database**
   - Change "Load Plants from API" to "Refresh Plants Database"
   - Update LoadPlantsFromAPI to read from PLANTS table
   - Update LoadIssuesForSelectedPlants to read from ISSUES table

4. **Update SelectionService.cs**
   - Add GetPlantsFromDatabase method
   - Add GetIssuesFromDatabase method

## Connection String
- Fixed in appsettings.json
- User: TR2000_STAGING
- Password: (corrected by user)
- Working now

## Important Files
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/Master_DDL.sql` - SINGLE source of truth for all DB objects
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/TR2KApp/Components/Pages/ETLOperations.razor` - Main ETL UI
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/TR2KBlazorLibrary/Services/SelectionService.cs` - Selection management
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/TR2KBlazorLibrary/Services/ETLService.cs` - ETL orchestration

## Testing Status
- ✅ Plants load from API works
- ✅ Oracle connection works
- ⚠️ Stored procedures need final compilation fix
- ❌ Full ETL flow not tested yet

## Next Session Should Start With:
1. Fix the pkg_etl_operations compilation error (EXTRACT function issue)
2. Update ETLService.cs to call the stored procedures
3. Modify UI to read from database instead of API
4. Test the complete ETL flow

## Notes
- Master_DDL.sql includes DROP statements for clean redeployment
- All procedures use dynamic SQL for JSON parsing where needed
- Proper error handling and logging implemented
- Transaction safety built into all procedures
