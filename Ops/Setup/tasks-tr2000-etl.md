# Task List: TR2000 ETL System Implementation

## Relevant Files

### Critical Reference Documentation
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Ops/Setup/TR2000_API_Endpoints_Documentation.md` - **CRITICAL**: Contains all endpoints and data fields to be transferred to database tables via ETL operations. Must be referenced when implementing any table structure.
  - **Section 1**: Operators and Plants (âœ… COMPLETE in Tasks 1-5)
  - **Section 2**: Issue References - 9 types (ðŸ“‹ NEW Task 6)
  - **Section 3**: PCS Details - 7 table types (ðŸ“‹ NEW Task 7)
  - **Section 4**: VDS Details - 44,000+ records (ðŸ“‹ NEW Task 8)
  - **Section 5**: BoltTension - 8 endpoints (ðŸ“‹ NEW Task 9)

### Database Schema & Procedures (ORACLE APEX SOLUTION)
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/Master_DDL.sql` - **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - Contains ALL database objects including:
  - Schema definitions (RAW_JSON, STG_*, CORE tables)
  - pkg_raw_ingest - RAW_JSON deduplication and insertion
  - pkg_parse_plants - JSON parsing for Plants endpoint
  - pkg_upsert_plants - MERGE procedures for PLANTS table
  - pkg_parse_issues - JSON parsing for Issues endpoint
  - pkg_upsert_issues - MERGE procedures for ISSUES table
  - pkg_etl_operations - ETL orchestration and logging
  - **pkg_api_client** - NEW: APEX_WEB_SERVICE API calls
  - **MISSING - MUST ADD**: pkg_selection_mgmt (currently in separate file)
  - **MISSING - MUST ADD**: apex_etl_control_action procedure
  - **MISSING - MUST ADD**: Views for APEX (v_etl_control_plants_lov, etc.)

### APEX Application Components (ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT)
- **Application**: TR2000 ETL Manager
- **Initial Setup**: Basic app with placeholder regions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: UI components added with each feature:
  - Selection Management â†’ Plant/Issue selection page
  - ETL Operations â†’ Control and monitoring pages
  - API Integration â†’ Test and refresh buttons
- **Future Enhancements**: Dashboard, statistics, themes
- **NO EXTERNAL HOSTING**: Runs entirely inside Oracle Database
- **Access**: Via browser at `http://localhost:8888/ords/` (ORDS on port 8888)
- **Workspace**: TR2000_ETL | **Username**: ADMIN | **Password**: Apex!1985


### Implementation Notes

- **Architecture**: Pure Oracle APEX solution (no external applications)
- **Database**: Master_DDL.sql is the SINGLE source of truth
- **Deployment**: Run Master_DDL.sql to drop and recreate everything
- **Version Control**: Git tracks all changes (no manual backups)
- **API Calls**: Using APEX_WEB_SERVICE from PL/SQL
- **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL**: NEVER use UTL_HTTP - only use APEX_WEB_SERVICE for all HTTP/HTTPS calls
- **Connection**: TR2000_STAGING/piping@host.docker.internal:1521/XEPDB1
- **Focus**: Plants and Issues first, then reference tables
- **Tools**: SQL*Plus client in /Database/tools/instantclient/
- **SQL*Plus Command**: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/tools/instantclient:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH && /workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/tools/instantclient/sqlplus -S TR2000_STAGING/piping@host.docker.internal:1521/XEPDB1`

### CURRENT STATUS (2025-08-24 - Session 2)
- **COMPLETED**: Database schema (Task 1), Basic APEX App (Task 2), Selection Management (Task 3), ETL Pipeline (Task 4), API Integration (Task 5)
- **IN PROGRESS**: Tasks 4.9-4.10 (APEX ETL pages), Task 5.10 (APEX API test page)
- **NEW TASKS ADDED**: 
  - Task 6: Issue Reference Tables (9 reference types from Section 2 of API)
  - Task 7: PCS Detail Tables (7 table types from Section 3 of API)
  - Task 8: VDS Detail Tables (Section 4 - includes 44,000+ records!)
  - Task 9: BoltTension Tables (8 endpoints from Section 5 of API)
- **ARCHITECTURE**: All new tables follow API â†’ RAW_JSON â†’ STG_* â†’ CORE pattern
- **BLOCKER**: Oracle wallet for HTTPS not being recognized (see WALLET_ISSUE_STATUS_2025_08_24.md)
- **NEXT PRIORITY**: Fix wallet issue, then populate plants from API
- **POST-PROJECT**: Automation (Task 10), Testing (Task 11)

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: ETL Data Flow & Selection Management Architecture

#### **1. Initial Data Population**
- **One-time load**: Fetch ALL plants from API to populate PLANTS table
- This provides the master list for user selection
- No issues are loaded initially (API optimization)

#### **2. User Selection Workflow**
1. **Plant Selection**:
   - User selects plants from PLANTS table via APEX UI
   - Selected plants saved to SELECTION_LOADER (is_active='Y')
   - Triggers automatic fetch of issues for ONLY selected plants
   
2. **Issue Selection**:
   - Issues dropdown populates with data for selected plants only
   - User selects specific issue revisions
   - Selected issues saved to SELECTION_LOADER with plant_id + issue_revision

#### **3. Full ETL Execution Order** (Processes ONLY selected data)
When user clicks "Run Full ETL", the system processes in this sequence:
1. **Issues** - Already fetched during selection
2. **Issue References** (Task 6) - For selected issues only:
   - PCS_REFERENCES, SC_REFERENCES, VSM_REFERENCES
   - VDS_REFERENCES, EDS_REFERENCES, MDS_REFERENCES  
   - VSK_REFERENCES, ESK_REFERENCES, PIPE_ELEMENT_REFERENCES
3. **PCS Details** (Task 7) - ONLY for PCS referenced in step 2
4. **VDS Details** (Task 8) - ONLY for VDS referenced in step 2
5. **BoltTension** (Task 9) - DEFERRED until all above complete successfully

#### **4. Change Management & Cascade Logic**
- **Plant change**: 
  - Deactivate old plant â†’ cascade deactivate its issues â†’ cascade deactivate all downstream
  - Activate new plant â†’ fetch its issues â†’ user selects issues â†’ fetch downstream
- **Issue change**:
  - Deactivate old issue â†’ cascade deactivate its references and downstream data
  - Activate new issue â†’ fetch its references â†’ fetch downstream details
- **Soft delete**: All tables use is_valid='N' instead of DELETE

#### **5. API Call Optimization Strategy**
- **Selection scoping**: Only fetch data for selected plants/issues (70% reduction)
- **SHA256 deduplication**: Skip unchanged API responses
- **Cascade fetching**: Only fetch downstream data that's actually referenced
- **Example**: 3 plants Ã— 2 issues = 6 API calls for issues + their references
  (vs 100+ plants Ã— all issues = 1000s of calls without selection)
