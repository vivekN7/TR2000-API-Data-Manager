# Task List: TR2000 ETL System Implementation

## Relevant Files

### Critical Reference Documentation
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Ops/Setup/TR2000_API_Endpoints_Documentation.md` - **CRITICAL**: Contains all endpoints and data fields to be transferred to database tables via ETL operations. Must be referenced when implementing any table structure.

### Database Schema & Procedures
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/Master_DDL.sql` - Main DDL file containing all schema definitions (RAW_JSON, STG_*, CORE, control tables)
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/Procedures/pkg_raw_ingest.sql` - Package for RAW_JSON deduplication and insertion
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/Procedures/pkg_parse_plants.sql` - JSON parsing procedures for Plants endpoint
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/Procedures/pkg_upsert_plants.sql` - MERGE procedures for CORE.PLANTS table
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/Procedures/pkg_parse_issues.sql` - JSON parsing procedures for Issues endpoint
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/Procedures/pkg_upsert_issues.sql` - MERGE procedures for CORE.ISSUES table
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/Procedures/pkg_etl_operations.sql` - ETL orchestration and logging procedures
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/Tests/test_etl_pipeline.sql` - PL/SQL unit tests for ETL operations

### C# Application Files
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/TR2KApp/Pages/ETLOperations.razor` - **SINGLE UNIFIED PAGE** for all ETL operations (selection, monitoring, testing, dashboard)
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/TR2KBlazorLibrary/Services/ETLService.cs` - Core ETL orchestration service using Dapper
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/TR2KBlazorLibrary/Services/SelectionService.cs` - Manages SELECTION_LOADER table operations
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/TR2KBlazorLibrary/Models/ETLModels.cs` - Data models for ETL entities
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/TR2KApp/appsettings.json` - Configuration including Oracle connection strings

### Test Files
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Tests/ETLService.Tests.cs` - Unit tests for ETL service
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Tests/SelectionService.Tests.cs` - Unit tests for selection service
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Tests/Fixtures/plants_response.json` - Mock API response for Plants endpoint
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Tests/Fixtures/issues_response.json` - Mock API response for Issues endpoint

### Notes

- The existing TR2000ApiService and ApiResponseDeserializer can be leveraged for API calls
- Database operations must use Dapper exclusively as per PRD requirements
- All transformations must be in Oracle stored procedures, not C# code
- **DO NOT** reuse legacy patterns without explicit permission - the previous attempt became too messy
- Focus on Plants and Issues FIRST - get these fully working before moving to references
- Keep most logic in Oracle as final orchestrator may be Oracle APEX (not C#)
- Use `dotnet test` to run C# unit tests
- PL/SQL tests should be executed directly in Oracle using the test scripts
