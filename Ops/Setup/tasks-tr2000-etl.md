# Task List: TR2000 ETL System Implementation

## Relevant Files

### Critical Reference Documentation
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Ops/Setup/TR2000_API_Endpoints_Documentation.md` - **CRITICAL**: Contains all endpoints and data fields to be transferred to database tables via ETL operations. Must be referenced when implementing any table structure.

### Database Schema & Procedures (ORACLE APEX SOLUTION)
- `/workspace/TR2000/TR2K/Database/Master_DDL.sql` - **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - Contains ALL database objects including:
  - Schema definitions (RAW_JSON, STG_*, CORE tables)
  - pkg_raw_ingest - RAW_JSON deduplication and insertion
  - pkg_parse_plants - JSON parsing for Plants endpoint
  - pkg_upsert_plants - MERGE procedures for PLANTS table
  - pkg_parse_issues - JSON parsing for Issues endpoint
  - pkg_upsert_issues - MERGE procedures for ISSUES table
  - pkg_etl_operations - ETL orchestration and logging
  - **pkg_api_client** - NEW: APEX_WEB_SERVICE API calls

### APEX Application Components (SIMPLIFIED - 2 PAGES ONLY)
- **Application**: TR2000 ETL Manager
- **Page 1**: Dashboard - Quick statistics and recent runs
- **Page 2**: ETL Operations - Everything in one page:
  - Plant selection (multi-select, max 10)
  - Issue selection (cascading from plants)
  - Action buttons (Refresh, Save, Run)
  - Execution log at bottom
- **NO EXTERNAL HOSTING**: Runs entirely inside Oracle Database
- **Access**: Via browser at `http://oracle-server:8080/apex`

### Legacy Files (NO LONGER USED - Kept for reference)
- ~~C# Application Files - Replaced by APEX~~
- ~~Blazor Components - Replaced by APEX pages~~
- ~~.NET Services - Replaced by PL/SQL packages~~

### Notes

- **ARCHITECTURE CHANGE**: Pivoted to pure Oracle APEX solution (2025-08-22)
- **CRITICAL**: Master_DDL.sql is the SINGLE source of truth for all database objects
- The Master_DDL.sql includes DROP statements for clean redeployment
- All API calls now made from Oracle using APEX_WEB_SERVICE
- UI provided by APEX pages (no external frontend needed)
- All logic remains in Oracle stored procedures
- Focus on Plants and Issues FIRST before moving to references
- PL/SQL tests should be executed directly in Oracle
- APEX application can be exported/imported for deployment

### CURRENT STATUS (2025-08-23) - ARCHITECTURE SIMPLIFIED! ðŸŽ‰
- **COMPLETED**: Task 7.0-7.9 - pkg_api_client now using APEX_WEB_SERVICE!
- **COMPLETED**: Task 3.8 & 3.10 - Added pr_purge_raw_json and dynamic endpoint processing
- **HTTPS WORKING**: Oracle wallet configured at C:\Oracle\wallet with Let's Encrypt certificates
- **APEX STATUS**: Fully functional with HTTPS! APEX_WEB_SERVICE working perfectly
- **CODE REDUCTION**: 70% less code compared to UTL_HTTP implementation
- **DATABASE CLEANUP**: Archived 90% of files, Master_DDL.sql is single source of truth
- **NEW FEATURES**: Added APEX helper procedures, views, and DBMS_SCHEDULER jobs
- **NEXT**: Task 8.0 - Build 2-page APEX application with full API integration

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Setup Core Database Schema for Plants and Issues ONLY
  - [x] 1.1 Review TR2000_API_Endpoints_Documentation.md to understand Plants and Issues data fields
  - [x] 1.2 Create Master_DDL.sql with RAW_JSON table (including sha256 hash, endpoint_key, plant, issue_rev columns)
        **IMPORTANT**: Master_DDL.sql is the ONLY SQL script to be updated during development. It includes DROP statements for clean redeployment.
  - [x] 1.3 Define STG_PLANTS staging table with all VARCHAR2 columns matching API response
  - [x] 1.4 Define STG_ISSUES staging table with all VARCHAR2 columns matching API response
  - [x] 1.5 Create PLANTS table with proper data types and is_valid soft delete flag
  - [x] 1.6 Create ISSUES table with proper data types and is_valid soft delete flag
  - [x] 1.7 Setup SELECTION_LOADER table for storing user-selected plants and issues
  - [x] 1.8 Create ETL control tables (CONTROL_ENDPOINTS, CONTROL_SETTINGS, CONTROL_ENDPOINT_STATE)
  - [x] 1.9 Define ETL_RUN_LOG and ETL_ERROR_LOG tables for monitoring and error tracking
  - [x] 1.10 Create indexes for performance optimization on key columns
- [x] 1.11 Populate CONTROL_ENDPOINTS with initial Plants + Issues configs
- [x] 1.12 Ensure all schema changes are reflected in Master_DDL.sql only. No other DDL scripts should exist outside this file
        **DEPLOYMENT NOTE**: Run Master_DDL.sql to drop and recreate all database objects cleanly. This is the ONLY script to maintain.
