# TR2000 API Data Manager - Development Progress Log

## 🔴 CRITICAL: This file must be updated after EVERY major change
Last Updated: 2025-08-17 (Session 14 - Deletion Cascade & Plant Loader Simplification)

## Current Session Summary (2025-08-17 - Session 14 COMPLETE)

### Session 14 Major Improvements:

#### 1. **Simplified Plant Loader - Removed Active/Inactive Complexity**
- **Before**: Plants had IS_ACTIVE flag, users had to toggle active/inactive status
- **After**: Plants in the loader are always processed - much simpler!
- **UI Changes**: Removed Status column and Activate/Deactivate buttons
- **Benefits**: Less confusion, cleaner code, clear scope control

#### 2. **Implemented Deletion Cascade for Issues**
- **Problem**: When plants removed from loader, their issues remained active causing unnecessary downstream API calls
- **Solution**: Added deletion cascade in PKG_ISSUES_ETL.PROCESS_SCD2
- **How it works**: 
  - Plants removed from ETL_PLANT_LOADER → their issues marked as deleted
  - Plants added back → issues automatically reactivated
  - ETL_PLANT_LOADER is now the single source of truth for scope
- **Benefits**: No orphaned data, clean downstream processing, full history preserved

#### 3. **Fixed UI Refresh Issues**
- **Problem**: Plant dropdown didn't refresh after loading plants
- **Solution**: Added StateHasChanged() after LoadPlantLoaderData()
- **Result**: Dropdown updates immediately without page refresh

#### 4. **Fixed Oracle Hex Conversion Error**
- **Problem**: ORA-01465 invalid hex number when comparing RAW with string literals
- **Solution**: Rewrote hash comparison logic to avoid NVL with 'x' and 'y' strings
- **Added**: Proper NULL handling with NVL and separators in hash calculations

#### 5. **Documentation Updates**
- Updated UI knowledge articles with deletion cascade explanation
- Updated SCD2_FINAL_DECISION.md with new pattern
- Added clear documentation about ETL_PLANT_LOADER as scope control

## Previous Session Summary (2025-08-17 - Session 13 Final)

### 1. Major UI Cleanup Following Material Design:
- **Removed color vomit**: Eliminated excessive use of bg-primary, bg-success, bg-warning, bg-info, bg-dark
- **Simplified color scheme**: 
  - Headers now use plain card-header with h6 text
  - Buttons use btn-primary for actions, btn-outline-secondary for secondary actions
  - Minimal use of badges (only bg-success/bg-secondary for status)
- **Cleaner layout**:
  - Smaller font sizes with "small" class
  - Consistent spacing with Bootstrap utilities
  - Less visual noise overall

### 2. Plant Loader Configuration UI:
- **Added Plant Loader Configuration section** as Section 2 in the UI
- **Fixed button issues**: Replaced icon-only buttons with text labels
  - "Activate/Deactivate" instead of blue outline button
  - "Remove" instead of red outline button  
  - Used btn-link style for cleaner appearance
- **Features**:
  - Checks if ETL_PLANT_LOADER table exists
  - Create table button if not exists
  - Dropdown to select and add plants
  - Table showing active/inactive plants with clear text actions
  - Shows count of active plants

### 3. Fixed Load Issues Bugs:
- **First Issue**: API returns field as "IssueRevision" not "Revision"
  - Fixed: Updated field name on line 828
- **Second Issue**: Date format parsing error ('30.04.2025 09:50' format)
  - Fixed: Created flexible ParseDateTime() method that tries multiple formats
  - Supports: European (dd.MM.yyyy), ISO (yyyy-MM-dd), US (MM/dd/yyyy), and more
  - Falls back to general parse if specific formats fail
  - Much safer than region-specific parsing

### 4. Applied Corporate Color Theme (#00346a) Throughout:
- **Fixed all pages**: Home, OracleETL (v1), OracleETLV2, PipeSizes
- **Updated all section headers** to use #00346a background with white text
- **Updated navbar** in NavMenu.razor to use #00346a
- **Fixed sidebar** in both MainLayout.razor.css AND app.css (removed purple gradient)
- **Knowledge Articles section** now uses #00346a header
- **Standardized badges**: Removed confusing colors (red for error log, blue for info)
  - Now using: green for permanent/success, secondary (gray) for temporary/info
- **Result**: Clean, consistent corporate branding with minimal color palette

### 5. Backend Implementation:
- **Created PlantLoaderEntry.cs and Plant.cs models**
- **Added 7 methods to OracleETLServiceV2.cs** for plant loader management
- **Fixed LoadIssuesForSelectedPlants()**: Removed LOAD_PRIORITY reference

### 6. Documentation Updates:
- **Updated TR2K_START_HERE.md**: Added rule #7 about maintaining knowledge articles
- **Key principle**: Always update UI knowledge articles when functionality changes

### 7. Files Modified:
- `/TR2KApp/Components/Pages/OracleETLV2.razor` - Complete UI redesign with #00346a headers
- `/TR2KApp/Components/Pages/OracleETL.razor` - Applied #00346a theme
- `/TR2KApp/Components/Pages/Home.razor` - Applied #00346a theme
- `/TR2KApp/Components/Pages/PipeSizes.razor` - Applied #00346a theme
- `/TR2KBlazorLibrary/Logic/Services/OracleETLServiceV2.cs` - Fixed Issues field names and flexible date parsing
- `/TR2KBlazorLibrary/Models/PlantLoaderEntry.cs` - New model file
- `/TR2KApp/Components/Layout/NavMenu.razor` - Applied #00346a theme
- `/TR2KApp/Components/Layout/MainLayout.razor.css` - Applied #00346a to sidebar
- `/TR2KApp/wwwroot/app.css` - Fixed sidebar gradient to #00346a
- `/Ops/TR2K_START_HERE.md` - Added knowledge article maintenance rule

### 8. CRITICAL FIX - Load Issues Not Working:
- **Root Cause Found**: PKG_ISSUES_ETL.PROCESS_SCD2 was just a placeholder with NULL!
- **Investigation Steps**:
  1. Checked console logs - showed "Processing 9 issues through orchestrator"
  2. Added better error handling to catch Oracle exceptions
  3. Examined DDL file - found PKG_ISSUES_ETL had empty implementation
- **Solution**: Fully implemented PKG_ISSUES_ETL package:
  - PROCESS_SCD2: Handles INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, REACTIVATE for issues
  - RECONCILE: Counts and validates all changes
- **Action Required**: Redeploy Oracle_DDL_SCD2_FINAL.sql to database
- **Files Updated**:
  - Oracle_DDL_SCD2_FINAL.sql - Added full PKG_ISSUES_ETL implementation
  - OracleETLServiceV2.cs - Added Oracle exception handling

### 9. Key Improvements Summary:
- **Date Parsing**: Now handles multiple formats safely without region-specific issues
- **UI Consistency**: Corporate blue (#00346a) applied throughout entire application
- **Badge Standardization**: Green for permanent, gray for temporary/info (no confusing colors)
- **Plant Loader**: Fully functional for controlling which plants to process
- **Load Issues**: Fixed with proper PKG_ISSUES_ETL implementation and flexible date parsing

## Previous Session Summary (2025-08-17 - Session 12)

### 1. UI Text Correction:
- **Fixed**: Updated OracleETLV2.razor to accurately describe cleanup behavior
- **Changed From**: "ETL_ERROR_LOG: 30 DAYS - Auto-purged nightly"
- **Changed To**: "ETL_ERROR_LOG: 30 DAYS - Cleaned after each ETL (automatic)"
- **Reason**: Cleanup actually runs after each ETL (in SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH), not as a scheduled nightly job
- **Verified**: SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH includes cleanup block after COMMIT (lines 1243-1278)

### 2. RAW_JSON Implementation (Phase 1 - No DBA Required!):
Based on GPT-5 feedback, implemented RAW_JSON audit trail with zero-privilege approach:

#### What Was Added:
- **RAW_JSON Table**: Stores compressed API responses for audit/forensics
- **SP_PURGE_RAW_JSON**: Cleanup procedure (no scheduler needed)
- **SP_INSERT_RAW_JSON**: Helper for easy inserts from C#
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Runs after each ETL (no DBA privileges required)

#### Key Features:
- **No Scheduled Jobs**: Cleanup runs in SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH after commit
- **Compressed Storage**: SECUREFILE with COMPRESS MEDIUM DEDUPLICATE
- **Best-Effort**: Failures don't affect ETL (non-critical)
- **30-Day Retention**: Automatically purged, no manual intervention

#### Files Modified:
- `Oracle_DDL_SCD2_FINAL.sql` - Added RAW_JSON table and procedures (FIXED LOB syntax)
- `OracleETLServiceV2.cs` - Added InsertRawJson() method, calls for Operators/Plants
- `OracleETLV2.razor` - Updated UI to show RAW_JSON is active

#### DDL Fix Applied:
- **Issue**: RAW_JSON table creation failed with ORA-00907 (missing parenthesis)
- **Cause**: Incorrect LOB storage syntax - can't put STORE AS inside column definition
- **Fix**: Moved LOB storage clauses outside the CREATE TABLE parentheses
- **NO UPGRADE SCRIPTS** - Only update the main DDL per policy!

#### Why This Matters:
- **Audit Trail**: Can replay/investigate what API sent on any date
- **Zero Complexity**: Just one extra insert, cleanup is automatic
- **No DBA Required**: Works with regular user permissions
- **Production Ready**: Aligned with final architecture but implemented now

   - Non-critical - failures don't break ETL
   - Better than scheduled jobs - preserves debug data if ETL fails

5. **Educational Value**:
   - Users can see EXACTLY what happens when they click Load
   - Step-by-step SQL with explanations
   - Understand data retention (what's kept, what's deleted)
   - Learn about SCD2, transactions, error handling
   - Build trust through transparency

## Previous Session Summary (2025-08-17 - Session 9)

### 🔴 CRITICAL DECISION POINT: SCD2 Implementation Completeness

#### Session 9 Major Discoveries:
1. **Oracle 21c XE DOES support STANDARD_HASH** - Confirmed and tested
2. **Implemented "Safe" SCD2** - Compares actual data values, not stored hashes
3. **Identified Missing Scenarios**:
   - ❌ Deletions not handled (records removed from API stay active)
   - ❌ Primary key changes create duplicates
   - ❌ Reactivations not tracked
   - ✅ Manual DB changes ARE detected (safe implementation)

#### The Big Decision: Complete vs Pragmatic
**Current Status**: Need to decide between:
- **Complete SCD2**: Handles ALL scenarios (deletions, reactivations, PK changes)
  - Pros: 100% accurate tracking, full audit trail
  - Cons: More complex, slightly slower (but still fast with our volumes)
- **Pragmatic SCD2**: Handles 99% of cases
  - Pros: Simpler, faster
  - Cons: Misses edge cases that "might not happen"

**User's Position**: "We must have 100% coverage of all possibilities"
**Recommendation**: Implement Complete SCD2 but OPTIMIZED (set-based, no loops)

#### Key Implementation Points:
1. **Deletion Handling**: MUST add logic to mark records as deleted when missing from API
2. **Hash Computation**: Use Oracle-native STANDARD_HASH, compare actual data (not stored hash)
3. **Change Types**: Track INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/REACTIVATE for full audit
4. **Performance**: Use indexes, set-based operations, avoid loops

#### Files Created This Session:
- `Oracle_DDL_SCD2_Complete.sql` - Full implementation (needs optimization)
- `Oracle_DDL_SCD2_Pragmatic.sql` - Simpler version
- `SCD2_Complete_Logic.sql` - Documentation of all scenarios

## Key Files and Their Purpose

### Core Application Files:
- `/TR2KApp/Components/Pages/OracleETL.razor` - Main ETL UI page
- `/TR2KBlazorLibrary/Logic/Services/OracleETLService.cs` - ETL service with all loading methods
- `/TR2KBlazorLibrary/Logic/Services/TR2000ApiService.cs` - API communication layer

### Documentation:
- `/Ops/TR2K_START_HERE.md` - Main project documentation (start here!)
- `/Ops/TR2K_PROGRESS.md` - This file - progress tracking
- `/Ops/Oracle_DDL_Complete_V4.sql` - Complete DDL script (DROP & RECREATE, includes ETL_PLANT_LOADER)
- `/Ops/ETL_Error_Handling_Guide.md` - Transaction safety documentation

### Key Methods Added Today:
1. `LoadPCSReferencesForSelectedPlants()` - Loads only for active plants
2. `GetAllPlants()` - Fetches all plants from database for dropdown
3. `CreatePlantLoaderTable()` - Creates ETL_PLANT_LOADER table
4. `AddPlantToLoader()` - Adds plant to loader configuration
5. `TogglePlantActive()` - Enable/disable plant for loading
6. `RemovePlantFromLoader()` - Remove plant from configuration

## Performance Improvements Achieved

### Before Plant Loader:
- Loading all 130 plants × multiple issues = 500+ API calls
- Time: 5-10 minutes for full load
- High risk of timeout errors

### After Plant Loader:
- Loading 3 selected plants × their issues = ~30 API calls  
- Time: < 30 seconds
- **Result: 94% reduction in API calls and processing time**

## Current Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: ETL_PLANT_LOADER table doesn't exist initially
**Solution**: Click "Create Loader Table" button in UI first time

### Issue 2: Plants dropdown shows empty initially
**Solution**: Load PLANTS table first, then refresh Plant Loader section

### Issue 3: PCS_NAME null error
**Solution**: Implemented with fallback to "Name" field and "UNKNOWN" default

## Next Session Starting Point

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/TR2000/TR2K/TR2KApp
   /home/node/.dotnet/dotnet run --urls "http://0.0.0.0:5003"
   ```

2. **Access the Oracle ETL page**: http://localhost:5003/oracle-etl

3. **Current State**:
   - Master tables (OPERATORS, PLANTS, ISSUES) loaded
   - Plant Loader system ready but ETL_PLANT_LOADER table needs creation
   - PCS, SC, VSM reference loading methods implemented and tested

4. **Immediate Next Steps**:
   - Test loading reference tables with selected plants
   - Implement remaining reference tables (VDS, EDS, MDS, VSK, ESK)
   - Add batch loading functionality
   - Create scheduler script for automatic loading
