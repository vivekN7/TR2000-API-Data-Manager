When I asked my dba on how much history we need to keep, he mentioned that there will need to be checks if data is already there or if there is a change, and only new or changes will be added. if no change then no new row added and that row is still valid. how do we incorporate this into our etl process? what do you recommend? here is some discussion reply from gpt5:


SCD2 (the quick logic)

Detect: For each incoming business key (e.g., PLANT_ID), check if a current row exists and whether anything changed (usually via a hash).

No change → do nothing.

New or changed →

Expire the old current row: set VALID_TO=now, IS_CURRENT='N'.

Insert a new row with the new values: VALID_FROM=now, IS_CURRENT='Y'.

This doesn’t create “duplicates”; it creates a timeline (versions). The table will grow over time (that’s the point of history), but it stays efficient if you index it right and only query IS_CURRENT='Y' for “latest”.

Will “checking if new or changed” slow things down?

It’s usually fast if you set it up properly:

Stage first: load the API data into a small STG_* table (or memory set), one batch at a time.

Hash compare: compute a stable SRC_HASH of the business fields you care about (not transient ones). Comparing two 64-char hashes is cheap.

Indexes: add a covering index on your “current” rows so the lookup is O(log N):

CREATE INDEX IX_DIM_PLANT_CURRENT ON DIM_PLANT (PLANT_ID) WHERE IS_CURRENT='Y';
(Oracle doesn’t have true partial indexes; commonly you use (PLANT_ID, IS_CURRENT) and query with IS_CURRENT='Y', or a function-based index like NVL(VALID_TO, DATE '9999-12-31').)

Array binding / batching in the ETL keeps roundtrips low.

Biggest time sinks are typically network calls and JSON parsing, not the change check.

In practice, with sane indexing, the check is very quick per row; throughput is dominated by I/O and JSON work.

Minimal Oracle pattern (SCD2 with a hash)

Assume:

Natural/business key = PLANT_ID

Current rows flagged by IS_CURRENT='Y'

Change detection via SRC_HASH

-- 1) Stage incoming rows (one batch) with a computed hash
-- STG_PLANT(PLANT_ID, SHORT_DESCRIPTION, AREA, ..., SRC_HASH)

-- 2) Find changes vs current
--   a) New keys (in STG but not in current DIM)
--   b) Changed keys (hash differs)

-- a) Insert NEW keys as fresh current rows
INSERT INTO DIM_PLANT (OPERATOR_KEY, PLANT_ID, SHORT_DESCRIPTION, AREA, ..., SRC_HASH,
                       VALID_FROM, VALID_TO, IS_CURRENT, LOAD_BATCH_ID)
SELECT s.OPERATOR_KEY, s.PLANT_ID, s.SHORT_DESCRIPTION, s.AREA, ..., s.SRC_HASH,
       SYSTIMESTAMP, NULL, 'Y', :batch_id
FROM STG_PLANT s
LEFT JOIN DIM_PLANT d
  ON d.PLANT_ID = s.PLANT_ID AND d.IS_CURRENT = 'Y'
WHERE d.PLANT_ID IS NULL;

-- b) For CHANGED keys, expire old and insert new
-- expire old
UPDATE DIM_PLANT d
SET d.VALID_TO = SYSTIMESTAMP, d.IS_CURRENT = 'N'
WHERE d.IS_CURRENT = 'Y'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM STG_PLANT s
    WHERE s.PLANT_ID = d.PLANT_ID
      AND s.SRC_HASH <> d.SRC_HASH
  );

-- insert new version
INSERT INTO DIM_PLANT (OPERATOR_KEY, PLANT_ID, SHORT_DESCRIPTION, AREA, ..., SRC_HASH,
                       VALID_FROM, VALID_TO, IS_CURRENT, LOAD_BATCH_ID)
SELECT s.OPERATOR_KEY, s.PLANT_ID, s.SHORT_DESCRIPTION, s.AREA, ..., s.SRC_HASH,
       SYSTIMESTAMP, NULL, 'Y', :batch_id
FROM STG_PLANT s
JOIN DIM_PLANT d_prev
  ON d_prev.PLANT_ID = s.PLANT_ID AND d_prev.IS_CURRENT = 'N'
WHERE s.SRC_HASH <> d_prev.SRC_HASH
  AND d_prev.VALID_TO = (SELECT MAX(d2.VALID_TO) FROM DIM_PLANT d2
                         WHERE d2.PLANT_ID = s.PLANT_ID);

Computing the hash

Pick a stable string of business fields (trimmed, normalized), then:

-- Example: hash a canonical concatenation
STANDARD_HASH(
  LOWER(TRIM(PLANT_ID)) || '|' ||
  LOWER(TRIM(SHORT_DESCRIPTION)) || '|' ||
  LOWER(TRIM(AREA)) || '|' ||
  NVL(LOWER(TRIM(CATEGORY)),'~')
, 'SHA256')


(For large JSON, compute the hash once when staging, not repeatedly.)

Indexing checklist (keeps it snappy)

On current rows lookup: (PLANT_ID, IS_CURRENT) or function-based index on (PLANT_ID, NVL(VALID_TO, DATE '9999-12-31')).

On hash comparisons (optional): (PLANT_ID, SRC_HASH) to speed “has it changed?” checks.

On history queries: (PLANT_ID, VALID_FROM, VALID_TO) helps time-slice questions.

Keeping growth reasonable

Keep a “current view” (like V_PCS_CURRENT) for day-to-day queries.

Consider history pruning rules if business agrees (e.g., collapse very old micro-revisions, or retain N years).

Optionally compress older partitions if tables get very large (Enterprise features).

Bottom line: your 2-step understanding is correct, and with hashes + proper indexes the “is it new or changed?” check is fast. The heavy lifting is fetching/JSON/parsing, not the comparison.


Why keep VALID_FROM / VALID_TO (SCD Type 2)

They let you answer:

“What was the PCS on 2024-12-31?”

“When did this value change?”

“How long was this setting effective?”

They also make it easy to:

Detect overlaps (data quality).

Do duration analytics (how long each version lived).

Reproduce old reports exactly (auditability).

Cost: two timestamps per versioned row—tiny storage; negligible performance impact if indexed.
