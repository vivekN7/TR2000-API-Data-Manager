I need help with some database setup

Hey Vivek! Happy to jump in. Give me a bit more context and I’ll tailor scripts, but here’s a clean starting point you can use right away for your usual stack (Oracle + local SQLite with Dapper).

Quick choices (tell me which you want)

Set up a new Oracle schema (user, tablespace, grants)

Spin up a local SQLite.dev file + seed data

Keep both in sync (pull from API → SQLite → push to Oracle)

Add Dapper repo + lightweight SQL migrations in C#

If you’re in a hurry, use the defaults below and I’ll adapt after.

1) Oracle schema bootstrap (Oracle SQL / PL/SQL)
-- create tablespace (adjust path/size/autoextend to your infra)
CREATE TABLESPACE SG_TBS DATAFILE 'sg_tbs01.dbf'
  SIZE 512M AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 128M MAXSIZE UNLIMITED
  EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT AUTO;

-- user + schema
CREATE USER SG_OWNER IDENTIFIED BY "StrongPwd!"
  DEFAULT TABLESPACE SG_TBS
  TEMPORARY TABLESPACE TEMP
  QUOTA UNLIMITED ON SG_TBS;

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO SG_OWNER;
GRANT CREATE VIEW, CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW, CREATE SYNONYM TO SG_OWNER;
-- If using DB links:
-- GRANT CREATE DATABASE LINK TO SG_OWNER;

-- Optional read-only app user
CREATE USER SG_APP IDENTIFIED BY "AnotherPwd!";
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO SG_APP;
GRANT SELECT ON SG_OWNER.PIPECLASS TO SG_APP;  -- add more as you create objects


Example schema (minimal, normalize as needed):

-- Tables
CREATE TABLE SG_OWNER.PIPECLASS (
  ID            NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  PROJECT_NO    VARCHAR2(20)   NOT NULL,
  CLASS_CODE    VARCHAR2(50)   NOT NULL,
  REVISION      VARCHAR2(10)   NOT NULL,
  UPDATED_AT    TIMESTAMP(6)   DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE SG_OWNER.PIPECLASS_SHEET (
  ID              NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  PIPECLASS_ID    NUMBER NOT NULL REFERENCES SG_OWNER.PIPECLASS(ID),
  ITEM_KEY        VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
  ITEM_VALUE      VARCHAR2(4000),
  UPDATED_AT      TIMESTAMP(6)  DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX IX_PIPECLASS_PROJECT_CLASS
  ON SG_OWNER.PIPECLASS (PROJECT_NO, CLASS_CODE);

CREATE INDEX IX_SHEET_PIPECLASS_ID ON SG_OWNER.PIPECLASS_SHEET (PIPECLASS_ID);

2) SQLite.dev bootstrap

From your app (first run), create the file and tables:

-- schema.sql (SQLite)
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS PipeClass (
  Id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  ProjectNo    TEXT NOT NULL,
  ClassCode    TEXT NOT NULL,
  Revision     TEXT NOT NULL,
  UpdatedAt    TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS PipeClassSheet (
  Id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  PipeClassId   INTEGER NOT NULL,
  ItemKey       TEXT NOT NULL,
  ItemValue     TEXT,
  UpdatedAt     TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  FOREIGN KEY (PipeClassId) REFERENCES PipeClass(Id)
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS IX_PipeClass_Project_Class
  ON PipeClass (ProjectNo, ClassCode);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS IX_Sheet_PipeClassId
  ON PipeClassSheet (PipeClassId);

3) Dapper + connection management (C#)
// Connections.cs
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SQLite; // System.Data.SQLite.Core
using Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client; // ODP.NET Managed

public static class Connections
{
    public static IDbConnection Sqlite(string path) =>
        new SQLiteConnection($"Data Source={path};Cache=Shared;");

    public static IDbConnection Oracle(string connString) =>
        new OracleConnection(connString);
}


Simple repository:

// PipeClassRepo.cs
using Dapper;

public record PipeClassDto(long Id, string ProjectNo, string ClassCode, string Revision, DateTime UpdatedAt);

public class PipeClassRepo
{
    private readonly Func<IDbConnection> _conn;

    public PipeClassRepo(Func<IDbConnection> connFactory)=> _conn = connFactory;

    public async Task<long> UpsertAsync(PipeClassDto dto)
    {
        using var db = _conn();
        // SQLite example (use Oracle MERGE for Oracle target)
        var sql = @"
INSERT INTO PipeClass (ProjectNo, ClassCode, Revision, UpdatedAt)
VALUES (@ProjectNo, @ClassCode, @Revision, @UpdatedAt); 
SELECT last_insert_rowid();";
        return await db.ExecuteScalarAsync<long>(sql, dto);
    }

    public Task<IEnumerable<PipeClassDto>> FindByProjectClassAsync(string projectNo, string classCode)
    {
        using var db = _conn();
        var sql = @"SELECT Id, ProjectNo, ClassCode, Revision, UpdatedAt
                    FROM PipeClass
                    WHERE ProjectNo = @projectNo AND ClassCode = @classCode";
        return db.QueryAsync<PipeClassDto>(sql, new { projectNo, classCode });
    }
}

4) Zero-frills SQL migrations (files + runner)

Directory structure:

/db
  /sqlite
    001_init.sql
    002_seed.sql
  /oracle
    001_init.sql
    002_indexes.sql


Tiny migration runner (runs *.sql in order, records applied versions):

// SqlMigrator.cs
using Dapper;
using System.Data;
using System.IO;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public static class SqlMigrator
{
    public static async Task RunAsync(IDbConnection db, string scriptsDir, string historyTable = "__Migrations")
    {
        await db.ExecuteAsync($"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {historyTable} (Id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, AppliedAt TEXT NOT NULL)");
        var applied = (await db.QueryAsync<string>($"SELECT Id FROM {historyTable}")).ToHashSet();

        foreach (var file in Directory.GetFiles(scriptsDir, "*.sql").OrderBy(f => f))
        {
            var id = Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(file);
            if (applied.Contains(id)) continue;

            var sql = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(file);
            await db.ExecuteAsync("BEGIN");
            try
            {
                await db.ExecuteAsync(sql);
                await db.ExecuteAsync($"INSERT INTO {historyTable}(Id, AppliedAt) VALUES(@id, datetime('now'))", new { id });
                await db.ExecuteAsync("COMMIT");
            }
            catch
            {
                await db.ExecuteAsync("ROLLBACK");
                throw;
            }
        }
    }
}


Usage:

// Startup snippet
var sqlitePath = "Data/stressgadget.dev.db";
Directory.CreateDirectory("Data");
using (var db = Connections.Sqlite(sqlitePath))
{
    await db.OpenAsync();
    await SqlMigrator.RunAsync(db, "db/sqlite");
}


For Oracle, swap to Connections.Oracle(connString) and point to db/oracle. For Oracle transactions use standard db.BeginTransaction() instead of the SQLite BEGIN/COMMIT strings.

5) Performance notes (since you saw slow joins before)

Link predicates early: push WHERE filters into CTEs so remote DB links return less.

Avoid row-by-row across DB links; prefer set-based INSERT /*+ APPEND */ SELECT ...@dblink.

Create covering indexes for join columns on both sides.

Check row counts and explain plans (DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_CURSOR)—especially when comparing single-table “fast” vs joined “slow” queries.

Batching: when moving from SQLite → Oracle, send rows in 500–2k batches with array binding in ODP.NET for big wins.

If you tell me:

DB names/paths,

target table list (even rough),

and whether you want Oracle-only, SQLite-only, or both with sync,

I’ll generate the exact scripts and a ready-to-run C# bootstrap for your repo in one go.

Talk to you in a bit, Vivek!

TRS2000_schema.txt
Document
This was an email I received from my database developer:

I managed to get ChatGPT assist me to create a complete DDL for our staging TR200 data (https://tr2000api.equinor.com/Home/Help)
Then I tried issue this prompt: create a ETL process using Oracle PLS/SQL apex_web_service package

Unfortunately, it fails and brakes down all the time. I guess I'm hitting the same problem you pointed out after the umbrella system was introduced.
Slow, fails, stops, almost impossible to use.

Can you try the exercise with our genAI subscription ?

Prompt 1: generate complete DDL for Oracle for all REST calls in : https://tr2000api.equinor.com/Home/Help
Prompt 2: create a ETL process using Oracle PLS/SQL apex_web_service package


See attached file

Can you explain to me all the commands that he has used, and what he is trying to do. Explain to me assuming that I only have basic knowledge of databases.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 24s

Hey Vivek! Here’s a plain‑English walkthrough of what your developer is doing, what each command means, and the end goal—assuming only basic DB knowledge.

The big picture (what he’s trying to do)

Goal: Build a staging database in Oracle that mirrors the TR2000 REST API (that URL) so you can query TR data locally, fast, and reliably.

How:

Create a schema and roles for clean access control.

Log every API call and store raw JSON payloads as‑is (for audit/replays).

Parse/map the JSON into a set of structured tables (dimensions/facts) designed for reporting and change history.

Later, use PL/SQL with APEX_WEB_SERVICE to call the REST endpoints on a schedule (ETL), write to raw tables, then upsert into the structured tables.

Everything below is from the attached DDL he generated.

Step‑by‑step: what the commands do
1) Create a workspace (user) and roles

CREATE USER TR2000_LOCAL ...;
Makes a new Oracle schema/user called TR2000_LOCAL where all these tables will live. He sets default tablespace/quotas so it has room to store data.

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO TR2000_LOCAL;
Gives the basic ability to log in and create objects (tables, etc.).

Inside that schema, he creates two roles:

TR2000_ETL (for the loader job/service)

TR2000_READ (for readers/analysts)

Why roles? You grant object privileges to roles once, then assign users to roles—much easier to manage than per‑user grants.

Note: there’s an early grant to ETL_LOG before the table exists; the comment says grants come after creation—so just run grants after tables are created or run the final grant block at the end.

2) Operational safety nets: logging + raw capture

ETL_LOG table
Stores one row per API call: which endpoint, HTTP status, timestamps, rows ingested, batch id, and any error text. This lets you retry safely and prove what happened during loads.

RAW_JSON table
Keeps the original API payloads in a JSON‑validated CLOB column, plus a KEY_FINGERPRINT (a hash of natural keys/URL) so you can deduplicate and replay. Indexed by endpoint and fingerprint for speed.

3) Core data model (designed for history)

You’ll see a consistent pattern in many tables:

VALID_FROM / VALID_TO / IS_CURRENT → classic type‑2 history (keep past versions, flag the live one).

SRC_HASH → hash of the source payload/record to detect changes cheaply.

LOAD_BATCH_ID → which ETL run loaded it.

Dimensions (who/what/where context)

DIM_OPERATOR (operator master) with a unique index on (OPERATOR_ID, VALID_TO) to enforce SCD2 rules.

DIM_PLANT (plants) links to operator and includes some JSON flags. Also SCD2 via (PLANT_ID, VALID_TO) unique index.

Facts (events/measures)

FACT_ISSUE records plant issues by revision/date, SCD‑style uniqueness (PLANT_KEY, ISSUE_REVISION, VALID_TO).

References tied to issues

ISSUE_REFERENCE is a generic child for lots of reference types in TR (PCS, VDS, SC, VSM, EDS, MDS, VSK, ESK, PIPE). It stores a small amount of structure plus the raw JSON for each reference. Indexed for common lookups.

Pipe Class Sheet (PCS) and children

PCS_HDR is the header row per PCS (by plant + PCS name + revision), plus metadata like status, design code, corrosion allowance, rev date, etc. There’s an SCD‑friendly unique index (PLANT_KEY, PCS_NAME, REVISION, VALID_TO).

Child tables hanging off one PCS:

PCS_TEMP_PRESS (temperature/pressure pairs) with an index on (PCS_KEY, TEMP_C).

PCS_PIPE_SIZE (sizes/schedules etc.) with index (PCS_KEY, NPS).

PCS_PIPE_ELEMENT (product form/material group, size ranges, etc.).

PCS_VALVE_ELEMENT (valve elements by VDS name).

PCS_NOTE (HTML notes per PCS).

Valve Data Sheet (VDS) and children

VDS_LIST (catalog of VDS) with SCD2 columns. Unique by (VDS_NAME, VALID_TO).

VDS_DETAIL (detailed VDS per revision, temp range, audit JSON), SCD2 unique on (VDS_NAME, REVISION, VALID_TO). There’s also an index by temperature range for typical filtering.

VDS_SUBSEGMENT optional child for sub‑sections/properties within a VDS detail.

Bolt‑Tension helper tables (for engineering tools)

Reference tables for bolt tension work you might do later in StressGadget:

BT_FLANGE_TYPE, BT_GASKET_TYPE, BT_BOLT_MATERIAL, BT_TENSION_FORCE, BT_TOOL, BT_TOOL_PRESSURE, BT_PLANT_INFO, BT_LUBRICANT. These store codes, descriptions, and sometimes JSON of source payloads.

4) Indexes and convenience views

Extra indexes to speed common queries, e.g., PCS_HDR by STATUS, LAST_UPDATE_TS, and VDS_DETAIL by temperature range.

Two “current view” helpers that hide SCD2 logic:

V_PCS_CURRENT → only rows where IS_CURRENT = 'Y' and VALID_TO IS NULL.

V_VDS_CURRENT → same idea for VDS.
You just query the view to get the latest state.

5) Final grants (permissions)

At the end he loops over every table and grants:

SELECT to TR2000_READ (readers)

SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE to TR2000_ETL (the loader)
This is a neat way to apply permissions to whatever tables exist, now and in future.

Where APEX_WEB_SERVICE fits (the ETL piece he mentions)

Your dev’s next step (Prompt 2) was to write PL/SQL that:

Calls each API endpoint using APEX_WEB_SERVICE.MAKE_REST_REQUEST (or similar).

Logs the call in ETL_LOG.

Inserts the raw JSON into RAW_JSON.

Parses JSON (with JSON_TABLE or PL/SQL) and upserts into the SCD2 tables (DIM_*, FACT_*, PCS_*, VDS_*, etc.).

Closes any current rows (VALID_TO) and marks new ones IS_CURRENT='Y' when data changes.

That ETL code isn’t in the file, but the schema is clearly designed for exactly this flow.

Why things might “fail/slow/stop” (common causes)

If his PL/SQL kept breaking, the usual culprits on Oracle/APEX REST calls are:

Network / SSL: missing corporate root cert in an Oracle wallet, or outbound proxy not configured for APEX.

ACLs (network access control lists) blocking outbound HTTP from the DB.

Timeouts / pagination not handled (TR endpoints can be chatty; you must loop pages).

CLOB/JSON size handling (must use CLOB vars, not VARCHAR2).

Error handling/retries: not catching 429/5xx and backing off.

(Those are implementation details you’ll address in the PL/SQL ETL, separate from the DDL.)

TL;DR

He made a clean Oracle staging schema with roles, logging, raw JSON capture, and a history‑aware (SCD2) model for TR2000 data.

There are dimension tables (operator, plant), fact tables (issues), and detailed structures for PCS and VDS with children, plus bolt‑tension references for your engineering use cases.

Convenience views give you “current” snapshots; indexes speed common filters; the grant loop simplifies permissions.

Next step is the ETL in PL/SQL using APEX_WEB_SERVICE to fetch, log, store raw JSON, and upsert into these tables.

If you’d like, I can generate a small, robust ETL skeleton (single endpoint first, with pagination, wallet/proxy hints, error handling, and SCD2 upsert) and then you can clone it across endpoints.

Talk soon, Vivek!

You said:
This was too technical and I don't understand quite a bit. Please simplify it further. First if it is possible make a data flow chart - it might be easier for me to understand this visually. Then, take the code from the attached file each section by section and then describe each statement or portion.

What each piece of the DDL is doing (simple explanations)

I’ll go section by section in the file you shared and explain in plain terms.

Create the schema user + base permissions

CREATE USER TR2000_LOCAL ...; creates a dedicated “home” (schema) in Oracle where all the tables live. Think of it like a private folder for this project.

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO TR2000_LOCAL; lets that user log in and create objects (tables, indexes, etc.).

Create two roles (permission bundles)

CREATE ROLE TR2000_ETL; for the loader job (the thing that calls the API and writes data).

CREATE ROLE TR2000_READ; for people or apps that only need to read.

Later, tables are granted to these roles so you can just add users to a role instead of granting table-by-table.

ETL_LOG (what happened when we loaded?)

A simple diary of each API call: which endpoint, when it ran, status code, how many rows, any error message. Super helpful for troubleshooting and re‑runs.

RAW_JSON (keep the originals)

Stores the raw API responses exactly as they came (in JSON). Two quick indexes help you find rows by endpoint or a fingerprint (a hash so duplicates are easy to spot). This is your “black box recorder.”

DIM_OPERATOR (who owns plants?)

A small reference table for operator info. It has “history” columns:

VALID_FROM/VALID_TO/IS_CURRENT so you can keep old versions and still know what’s current.

A unique index makes sure you don’t have two “current” versions at once.

DIM_PLANT (plants/platforms etc.)

Each plant links to an operator (OPERATOR_KEY). Similar history columns as above. There’s also a JSON field for misc flags that don’t fit neatly in columns. Unique index again to keep the history tidy.

FACT_ISSUE (issue/revision per plant)

This captures “issues” (think: a dated revision snapshot) for a plant. It links to DIM_PLANT. Same history pattern so you can see how it changed over time. Unique index prevents duplicate “current” versions of the same plant+revision.

ISSUE_REFERENCE (what’s attached to an issue)

A generic child table listing references attached to an issue: PCS, VDS, and others. It stores the type (e.g., ‘PCS’), the name (e.g., PCS name), optional revision, and the raw JSON for that reference. Indexed for fast lookups by issue and by type/name.

PCS tables (Pipe Class Sheet and details)

PCS_HDR: One row per PCS (per plant + PCS name + revision). Stores high-level info (status, design code, corrosion allowance, rev date) and a JSON snapshot of the header. History columns included; a unique index avoids duplicates.

PCS_TEMP_PRESS: For each PCS, the allowable pressure across temperatures. Indexed by (PCS_KEY, TEMP_C) so plotting/queries are quick.

PCS_PIPE_SIZE: Size table (NPS, OD, WT, schedule, etc.). Indexed by (PCS_KEY, NPS) for fast sizing lookups.

PCS_PIPE_ELEMENT: The “what materials/forms are allowed” section (product form, material group, ranges). Indexed by product form.

PCS_VALVE_ELEMENT: Valve elements for the PCS (links to VDS by name). Indexed by VDS name.

PCS_NOTE: Free‑form notes per PCS (HTML allowed).

VDS tables (Valve Data Sheet and details)

VDS_LIST: Catalog of VDS items (status, rating class, end connection, etc.), with history columns so older definitions aren’t lost. Unique index avoids “two currents.”

VDS_DETAIL: Specific revisioned details (valve type id, rating class id, temp range, description), also with history. Unique index on name+revision.

VDS_SUBSEGMENT (optional): If a VDS detail has subsections/properties, they land here as child rows. Indexed by parent.

BT_* helper tables (for bolt tension workflows later)

Reference tables for things like flange types, gasket types, bolt materials, tool pressures, lubricants, etc. These are simple code/description lists (some with JSON payloads) that your engineering tools can use.

Helpful indexes

Extra indexes to make common queries fast:

On PCS_HDR.STATUS, PCS_HDR.LAST_UPDATE_TS (typical filters).

On VDS_DETAIL temperature range (common search criterion).

Views that always show the “current” rows

V_PCS_CURRENT: shows only rows where IS_CURRENT = 'Y' and VALID_TO is null for PCS.

V_VDS_CURRENT: same idea for VDS.
Use these when you “just want the latest” without thinking about history.

Final grants (give access in one sweep)

A small PL/SQL block loops all tables and:

Gives readers (TR2000_READ) SELECT.

Gives the loader (TR2000_ETL) full DML (insert/update/delete).
This way, any new tables you add later get permissions automatically when you re‑run the block.

How the ETL fits later (in simple terms)

A small PL/SQL program uses Oracle’s web call package to call the API, page through results, and save the raw JSON.

It then picks out fields from the JSON and fills the right tables above.

If something changes, it closes the old row (VALID_TO) and opens a new one—so you always have history.

If you want, I can turn this into a tiny starter ETL (one endpoint end‑to‑end) with comments you can read like a recipe.

Want me to generate that next, Vivek?

You said:
can you show me this chart in a canvas or do i need to copy paste it to mermaid?
ChatGPT said:

I’ve put the data flow into a canvas so you can see it visually without needing to paste Mermaid code yourself.

Do you want me to now add your full SQL file into this same canvas, with plain-English explanations after each section so it reads like a guided walkthrough?

You said:
but it is still code and not a visual chart
ChatGPT said:

Right now in our canvas it’s still showing as code because I dropped the Mermaid diagram directly in there — the canvas doesn’t render Mermaid charts visually.

If you want an actual visual chart you can view right away without copy-pasting:

I can turn that same flow into an image (PNG/SVG) and embed it so you see it as a diagram.

Or, if you want to keep it editable, you could paste the Mermaid code into an online viewer (like mermaid.live) and export it as an image.

Do you want me to just generate the rendered diagram as an image for you so you see it immediately?

You said:
yes turn into an image. and then do the same for the sql file as well with plain english explanations after each section like a guided walkthrough

If you want these combined into a single PDF booklet, I can export that as well. Want me to do that? 

You said:
what does "SCD Type 2 (Slowly Changing Dimension)" mean in terms of database management
ChatGPT said:

Great question, Vivek — this comes up a lot in data warehousing. Let me keep it very clear and practical.

“Slowly Changing Dimension” (SCD)

A dimension table is a table that describes an entity, like DIM_PLANT or DIM_OPERATOR (who/what/where things are).

“Slowly changing” means the attributes (like name, description, status) don’t change often, but when they do, you have to decide how to handle history.

There are different types of SCD strategies.
Type 2 (SCD2) is the most common.

SCD Type 2 (what it means)

Instead of overwriting old data when something changes, you:

Keep the old row (but mark it as no longer current).

Insert a new row with the updated values.

Use extra columns to track history.

Typical extra columns:

VALID_FROM → when this version started being true.

VALID_TO → when it stopped being true (null means “still current”).

IS_CURRENT → a simple Y/N flag.

SRC_HASH → fingerprint to check if anything actually changed.

Example

Say you have a plant PLANT_ID = "P-100".

2022: its category = "Onshore".

2025: the company reclassifies it as "Offshore".

Without SCD2: you’d just update the row → you lose the history that it used to be “Onshore”.

With SCD2:

Old row: "Onshore", VALID_FROM=2022-01-01, VALID_TO=2025-01-01, IS_CURRENT='N'.

New row: "Offshore", VALID_FROM=2025-01-01, VALID_TO=null, IS_CURRENT='Y'.

Now you can answer:

“What’s the current classification?” → query rows where IS_CURRENT='Y'.

“What was it classified as in 2023?” → query where 2023 BETWEEN VALID_FROM AND VALID_TO.

Why your developer used SCD2

Because TR2000 data changes slowly but importantly:

Operators, plants, PCS, VDS… they evolve over time.

You don’t want to lose old revisions (auditability, reporting for old projects).

The views V_PCS_CURRENT and V_VDS_CURRENT are shortcuts to only see the latest records without thinking about history.

✅ In short:
SCD Type 2 is a database design pattern where every change creates a new row instead of overwriting the old one, so you always have full history + current state.

Would you like me to illustrate this with a before/after table example (like a little mock data table showing how rows evolve under SCD2)?

You said:
what other types are there? is there SCD1? SCD3? SCD99??
ChatGPT said:

Haha, yes! 😀 The “SCD” types are kind of like a menu of strategies for handling changes in dimension tables. Let me break them down simply:

📚 The Common Ones
SCD Type 0 – Retain Original

Do nothing: keep the first value forever, never update.

Useful for things that should never change (like a birth date).

SCD Type 1 – Overwrite

Just update the row in place.

Old values are lost.

Example: fixing a typo in PLANT_NAME. You don’t care about the wrong spelling — just correct it.

SCD Type 2 – Add New Row (Full History)

The one we just discussed.

Insert a new row every time something changes.

Track with VALID_FROM, VALID_TO, IS_CURRENT.

Gives you complete history.

Used in your TR2000 schema.

SCD Type 3 – Add New Column (Limited History)

Keep the old value in a special “previous value” column.

You only track one change (current + one previous).

Example: CURRENT_OPERATOR, PREVIOUS_OPERATOR.

Good when you just need a little history but not full timeline.

📦 Hybrids & Variants

Over the years, people combined or invented variations:

Type 4 – Separate History Table

Current value stays in the main dimension.

All past values go into a separate “history” table.

Keeps the main table small/fast.

Type 6 – Hybrid (1+2+3)

Overwrite certain fields, keep history for others, store previous values in columns.

A mash-up for complex needs.

🤪 “SCD 99”

There’s no official SCD99. That’s usually said jokingly to mean “we’ve invented yet another custom strategy”.

In practice:

0–3 are the most widely cited in textbooks.

4–6 appear in Kimball’s Data Warehouse Toolkit and real projects.

Beyond that, teams just define their own rules.

✅ Summary

SCD0: Never change (keep original).

SCD1: Overwrite (no history).

SCD2: New row per change (full history).

SCD3: Add column for previous (limited history).

SCD4: History table (split current vs old).

SCD6: Hybrid (combo of 1,2,3).

SCD99: Joke → “any other crazy custom approach.” 😅

Would you like me to draw a small comparison chart with examples (like Plant classification showing how each SCD type would handle a change)?

SCD Type Comparison

I’ve made a comparison table showing how each SCD type would handle a plant’s classification changing from Onshore → Offshore in 2025.

You can see clearly which strategies lose history, which keep full history, and which keep only partial.

Do you want me to also make this into a visual diagram (side-by-side timeline) so you can see the evolution across types more intuitively? 

You said:
when i asked how much history should be saved, my dba mentioned that each record will be checked if there is a change and then that row will be updated. that seems to be a different way than scd2 doesnt it? is that some industry standard approach?
ChatGPT said:

Good observation, Vivek 👌 — you’ve picked up on a subtle but important difference.

What your DBA described

“Each record will be checked if there is a change and then that row will be updated.”

That sounds like:

Compare incoming data (from TR2000 API) with what’s already in Oracle.

If nothing changed → do nothing (saves work).

If something changed → update the row in place.

👉 That is essentially SCD Type 1 behavior (overwrite), not Type 2.

You only keep the latest value.

Historical values are lost.

Why your schema has VALID_FROM / VALID_TO / IS_CURRENT

The schema you showed me is clearly designed for SCD Type 2:

Every change should result in a new row.

Old row gets VALID_TO date and IS_CURRENT='N'.

New row starts with VALID_FROM = today, IS_CURRENT='Y'.

So what your DBA said doesn’t fully match the schema they generated.

Is “update-in-place” an industry standard?

Yes — but only for SCD Type 1 use cases:

When history isn’t needed.

Example: fixing typos, updating descriptions, or when business says “we only care about the current truth”.

In data warehousing / staging, though:

Most companies prefer SCD2 for critical reference data (operators, plants, PCS, VDS) because they need to know what it was at any point in time.

Updating in place is simpler and faster, but you lose auditability.

Likely explanation

The schema is set up for SCD2.

The DBA’s comment was describing the mechanics of detecting changes (using SRC_HASH or field comparisons).

The correct SCD2 process is:

Compare → if no change, do nothing.

If change, expire old row (set VALID_TO, IS_CURRENT='N') and insert new row.

If instead you just “update the row” → you’ve effectively downgraded to SCD1.

✅ So the industry standard for history-aware systems is SCD2.
SCD1 (update in place) is standard only when history doesn’t matter.
Many pipelines even use a mix: some attributes Type 1, others Type 2.

Do you want me to show you a step-by-step mini example in SQL of how an ETL job decides between “no change”, “Type 1 update”, and “Type 2 new row”? That might make it click.

You said:
so what i undertsand then is:
1) First compare if row is new, or if row exists any change (by doing a hash check)
2) if it is new, or change, then add the new row and make the old row (iscurrent = N)

that way table remains small instead of having several multiple duplicates.
would this "checking if new or changed" end up taking more time for operations? or quite fast?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 7s

Hey Vivek — you’ve got it mostly right, and here’s the crisp version plus how to keep it fast.

What happens in SCD2 (the quick logic)

Detect: For each incoming business key (e.g., PLANT_ID), check if a current row exists and whether anything changed (usually via a hash).

No change → do nothing.

New or changed →

Expire the old current row: set VALID_TO=now, IS_CURRENT='N'.

Insert a new row with the new values: VALID_FROM=now, IS_CURRENT='Y'.

This doesn’t create “duplicates”; it creates a timeline (versions). The table will grow over time (that’s the point of history), but it stays efficient if you index it right and only query IS_CURRENT='Y' for “latest”.

Will “checking if new or changed” slow things down?

It’s usually fast if you set it up properly:

Stage first: load the API data into a small STG_* table (or memory set), one batch at a time.

Hash compare: compute a stable SRC_HASH of the business fields you care about (not transient ones). Comparing two 64-char hashes is cheap.

Indexes: add a covering index on your “current” rows so the lookup is O(log N):

CREATE INDEX IX_DIM_PLANT_CURRENT ON DIM_PLANT (PLANT_ID) WHERE IS_CURRENT='Y';
(Oracle doesn’t have true partial indexes; commonly you use (PLANT_ID, IS_CURRENT) and query with IS_CURRENT='Y', or a function-based index like NVL(VALID_TO, DATE '9999-12-31').)

Array binding / batching in the ETL keeps roundtrips low.

Biggest time sinks are typically network calls and JSON parsing, not the change check.

In practice, with sane indexing, the check is very quick per row; throughput is dominated by I/O and JSON work.

Minimal Oracle pattern (SCD2 with a hash)

Assume:

Natural/business key = PLANT_ID

Current rows flagged by IS_CURRENT='Y'

Change detection via SRC_HASH

-- 1) Stage incoming rows (one batch) with a computed hash
-- STG_PLANT(PLANT_ID, SHORT_DESCRIPTION, AREA, ..., SRC_HASH)

-- 2) Find changes vs current
--   a) New keys (in STG but not in current DIM)
--   b) Changed keys (hash differs)

-- a) Insert NEW keys as fresh current rows
INSERT INTO DIM_PLANT (OPERATOR_KEY, PLANT_ID, SHORT_DESCRIPTION, AREA, ..., SRC_HASH,
                       VALID_FROM, VALID_TO, IS_CURRENT, LOAD_BATCH_ID)
SELECT s.OPERATOR_KEY, s.PLANT_ID, s.SHORT_DESCRIPTION, s.AREA, ..., s.SRC_HASH,
       SYSTIMESTAMP, NULL, 'Y', :batch_id
FROM STG_PLANT s
LEFT JOIN DIM_PLANT d
  ON d.PLANT_ID = s.PLANT_ID AND d.IS_CURRENT = 'Y'
WHERE d.PLANT_ID IS NULL;

-- b) For CHANGED keys, expire old and insert new
-- expire old
UPDATE DIM_PLANT d
SET d.VALID_TO = SYSTIMESTAMP, d.IS_CURRENT = 'N'
WHERE d.IS_CURRENT = 'Y'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM STG_PLANT s
    WHERE s.PLANT_ID = d.PLANT_ID
      AND s.SRC_HASH <> d.SRC_HASH
  );

-- insert new version
INSERT INTO DIM_PLANT (OPERATOR_KEY, PLANT_ID, SHORT_DESCRIPTION, AREA, ..., SRC_HASH,
                       VALID_FROM, VALID_TO, IS_CURRENT, LOAD_BATCH_ID)
SELECT s.OPERATOR_KEY, s.PLANT_ID, s.SHORT_DESCRIPTION, s.AREA, ..., s.SRC_HASH,
       SYSTIMESTAMP, NULL, 'Y', :batch_id
FROM STG_PLANT s
JOIN DIM_PLANT d_prev
  ON d_prev.PLANT_ID = s.PLANT_ID AND d_prev.IS_CURRENT = 'N'
WHERE s.SRC_HASH <> d_prev.SRC_HASH
  AND d_prev.VALID_TO = (SELECT MAX(d2.VALID_TO) FROM DIM_PLANT d2
                         WHERE d2.PLANT_ID = s.PLANT_ID);

Computing the hash

Pick a stable string of business fields (trimmed, normalized), then:

-- Example: hash a canonical concatenation
STANDARD_HASH(
  LOWER(TRIM(PLANT_ID)) || '|' ||
  LOWER(TRIM(SHORT_DESCRIPTION)) || '|' ||
  LOWER(TRIM(AREA)) || '|' ||
  NVL(LOWER(TRIM(CATEGORY)),'~')
, 'SHA256')


(For large JSON, compute the hash once when staging, not repeatedly.)

Indexing checklist (keeps it snappy)

On current rows lookup: (PLANT_ID, IS_CURRENT) or function-based index on (PLANT_ID, NVL(VALID_TO, DATE '9999-12-31')).

On hash comparisons (optional): (PLANT_ID, SRC_HASH) to speed “has it changed?” checks.

On history queries: (PLANT_ID, VALID_FROM, VALID_TO) helps time-slice questions.

Keeping growth reasonable

Keep a “current view” (like V_PCS_CURRENT) for day-to-day queries.

Consider history pruning rules if business agrees (e.g., collapse very old micro-revisions, or retain N years).

Optionally compress older partitions if tables get very large (Enterprise features).

Bottom line: your 2-step understanding is correct, and with hashes + proper indexes the “is it new or changed?” check is fast. The heavy lifting is fetching/JSON/parsing, not the comparison.

Want me to tailor the hash + indexes for a specific table (PCS or VDS) so you can drop it straight in?

You said:
do we really need the "valid_to" and "valid_from" ?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 7s

Short answer: you only need VALID_FROM/VALID_TO if you care about “what was true on a given date.”
If you only ever need the latest values, drop them and use SCD Type 1 (overwrite) or just an IS_CURRENT flag + UPDATED_AT.

Why keep VALID_FROM / VALID_TO (SCD Type 2)

They let you answer:

“What was the PCS on 2024-12-31?”

“When did this value change?”

“How long was this setting effective?”

They also make it easy to:

Detect overlaps (data quality).

Do duration analytics (how long each version lived).

Reproduce old reports exactly (auditability).

Cost: two timestamps per versioned row—tiny storage; negligible performance impact if indexed.

Minimum you can get away with (if you still want history)

If you want history but prefer less bookkeeping:

Keep only VALID_FROM and IS_CURRENT, compute the end date on the fly:

SELECT t.*,
       LEAD(VALID_FROM) OVER (PARTITION BY PLANT_ID ORDER BY VALID_FROM)
         AS VALID_TO_computed
FROM DIM_PLANT t
WHERE PLANT_ID = :id;


This gives each row’s end date as the next row’s start. You still can time-slice, you just don’t store VALID_TO.

Version number instead of dates
Add VERSION_NO (1,2,3,…) + IS_CURRENT. You can still reconstruct order, but you lose exact calendar boundaries unless you also keep UPDATED_AT.

If you don’t need history

Choose one of these simpler patterns:

SCD1 (overwrite): just update the row; keep UPDATED_AT for info.

Current + History table (Type 4): current row in the main table; append old versions to a separate *_HIST table only when something changes.

Data quality guard (if you keep dates)

Whichever variant you pick, enforce “no overlapping versions per key”:

Expire the old current row before inserting the new one:

UPDATE DIM_PLANT
SET VALID_TO = SYSTIMESTAMP, IS_CURRENT = 'N'
WHERE PLANT_ID = :id AND IS_CURRENT = 'Y';

INSERT INTO DIM_PLANT (..., VALID_FROM, VALID_TO, IS_CURRENT)
VALUES (..., SYSTIMESTAMP, NULL, 'Y');


Index for speed & integrity:

-- Fast lookups for current rows
CREATE INDEX IX_DIM_PLANT_CUR ON DIM_PLANT (PLANT_ID, IS_CURRENT);

-- Helpful for time-slice queries
CREATE INDEX IX_DIM_PLANT_Timeline ON DIM_PLANT (PLANT_ID, VALID_FROM);

Recommendation for your TR2000 staging

Given audit/reproducibility needs (PCS/VDS revisions, plant/operator changes), I’d keep SCD2 with at least VALID_FROM (and optionally compute VALID_TO with LEAD).
If business later says “we’ll never time-travel,” we can simplify to SCD1 and archive the historical table.

If you tell me which tables you’d like to simplify, I’ll rewrite their DDL to:

(A) SCD2 minimal (only VALID_FROM + IS_CURRENT), or

(B) SCD1 (no history) + a lightweight *_HIST archive.

You said:
what is the industry standard when it comes to handling the detailed changes. for example:
1) What happens when someone manually changes a value in the table. In this case the hash key doesnt change and think its ok, and so most likely corrupt data will continue to live after next exports
2) What happens if source data deletes a row, would that row get set to "iscurrent = N"?
3) what happens if source data has duplicate rows?
4) what happens if source data keeps everything the same but changes the main primary key (like "operatorID"
5) many other options that im not thinking of right now but could happen....
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 10s

Great questions, Vivek. Here’s how teams typically handle each of those “messy reality” cases with an SCD2-style warehouse. I’ll keep it practical and opinionated so you can implement it.

Ground rules (industry standard)

Only the ETL writes. Human DML on staging/warehouse tables is blocked.

Append-only semantics. Changes create new versions; old rows are never edited except to close them (VALID_TO, IS_CURRENT='N').

Staging first. Land source data into STG_* tables exactly as received (after minimal typing), then validate/clean/dedupe before touching dimensions.

Quarantine bad data. Rows that fail rules go to REJECT_* (with reason) and do not enter the model.

Full audit trail. Keep RAW_JSON, ETL_LOG, and LOAD_BATCH_ID everywhere.

1) “What if someone manually changes a value in the table?”

Don’t allow it. This is a process control issue, not an SCD design issue.

Controls:

RBAC: Only role TR2000_ETL gets INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE; users get TR2000_READ (SELECT only).

DB trigger (belt-and-braces) to reject DML unless SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV','SESSION_USER') is the ETL account (or a trusted app user).

Daily reconciliation job comparing current dimension snapshot vs source snapshot (counts + hashes). Any drift ⇒ alert.

Example reject trigger (pattern):

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER dim_plant_block_manual_dml
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON DIM_PLANT
BEGIN
  IF SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV','SESSION_USER') <> 'TR2000_ETL_USER' THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Direct DML is not allowed. Use ETL.');
  END IF;
END;
/

2) “What if source deletes a row?”

Standard policy is soft-delete as a new version:

Detect keys that were present yesterday but not today (anti-join STG vs current DIM).

Close the current row: VALID_TO = now, IS_CURRENT='N', and set DELETED_FLAG='Y' (add this column).

Do not physically delete; history remains.

Anti-join pattern:

-- Keys that disappeared in today’s snapshot:
SELECT d.PLANT_ID
FROM DIM_PLANT d
LEFT JOIN STG_PLANT s ON s.PLANT_ID = d.PLANT_ID
WHERE d.IS_CURRENT = 'Y' AND s.PLANT_ID IS NULL;

-- Mark them deleted (Type 2 close)
UPDATE DIM_PLANT d
SET VALID_TO = SYSTIMESTAMP, IS_CURRENT = 'N', DELETED_FLAG='Y'
WHERE d.IS_CURRENT='Y'
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM STG_PLANT s WHERE s.PLANT_ID = d.PLANT_ID);

3) “What if source has duplicate rows?”

Never load duplicates into dimensions. Decide a rule and enforce it in staging:

Common rules:

Latest-wins (by source timestamp or revision).

Highest-priority wins (if there’s a status or quality flag).

Quarantine if duplicates disagree on critical fields.

Dedupe in staging (example latest-wins):

-- Keep one row per business key by latest source_ts
CREATE TABLE STG_PLANT_DEDUP AS
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT s.*,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY PLANT_ID ORDER BY SOURCE_TS DESC) rn
  FROM STG_PLANT s
)
WHERE rn = 1;


Then use STG_PLANT_DEDUP for SCD2 compare.

4) “What if source keeps everything the same but changes the main primary key (e.g., OperatorID)?”

This is the hardest class of problem. Best practice:

Prefer a stable business key. If the source offers an immutable ID (GUID), use that as the natural key.

If the natural key changes (renumbering), treat it as a Type 2 change that introduces a new natural key. You do not rewrite history.

Maintain a crosswalk table to link old and new keys for reporting joins:

OPERATOR_KEY_XWALK
-------------------
OPERATOR_KEY   -- surrogate (FK from DIM_OPERATOR)
OLD_OPERATOR_ID
NEW_OPERATOR_ID
CHANGED_AT


ETL step:

Detect “same entity, new ID” (source usually provides a parent GUID or an explicit “rekey” event; if not, you may need fuzzy logic + manual approval).

Close old row, insert new dimension row with the new OperatorID.

Record mapping in *_XWALK. Facts continue to point to the same surrogate OPERATOR_KEY.

Key idea: Facts should join to dimension surrogate keys (identity columns). Natural key changes do not force you to rewrite facts.

5) Other common cases & standard handling
a) Partial attribute updates (some fields null/missing)

Don’t overwrite with nulls unless source explicitly signals a cleared value.

Use a merge that only updates provided fields; otherwise carry forward previous values (business-approved).

b) Late-arriving dimensions / early-arriving facts

Use “Unknown” members (e.g., OPERATOR_KEY=0) then backfill once the true dimension arrives.

Keep a job that attempts backfill for recent facts.

c) Out-of-order updates (older snapshot arrives late)

If the snapshot’s as-of timestamp is older than your current version, either:

Quarantine (default), or

Insert it as historical if it cleanly fits between two versions (advanced).

d) JSON drift (schema changes in source)

Keep RAW_JSON always.

Parser layer uses tolerant extraction (NVL defaults).

Add new columns via migrations as fields stabilize; backfill from RAW_JSON where feasible.

e) Performance & idempotency

Build SRC_HASH in staging from only the business fields that define a change (ignore volatile fields like lastSeen).

Use MERGE or the “expire+insert” two-step in a single transaction per batch.

Array bind DML; index (BUSINESS_KEY, IS_CURRENT) and (BUSINESS_KEY, VALID_FROM).

Quick policy checklist you can adopt

Access control

Read-only role for analysts.

ETL role for writes; block manual DML with triggers.

Staging discipline

Land → Deduplicate → Validate → Hash → Compare → Load.

Change logic

No change: do nothing.

Change: close old (Type 2), insert new.

Delete: soft-delete (Type 2 close + DELETED_FLAG='Y').

Data quality

Unique constraint on (BusinessKey, VALID_TO) to prevent overlapping currents.

REJECT_* tables with reason codes.

Daily reconciliation report (row counts & hash totals per entity).

Key stability

Use surrogate keys in facts.

Maintain crosswalks for natural key changes.

If you want, I can turn this into a ready-to-run SQL + PL/SQL “SCD2 toolkit” for one of your tables (say DIM_PLANT) with:

Staging table & dedupe view,

Hash calc,

Merge/expire/insert logic,

Soft-delete handling,

Triggers for write-protection, and

A reconciliation report query.

You said:
you mentioned raw_json. In this particular case, there are many-to-many and 1-to-many relationships. Meaning table 7 data is generated from iterating table 3,4,5 which also depend on table 1,2, and we also dont need every single plant or issue or spec since we only want the info relevant for current projects. how do you then handle it with the raw_json and etl method?
ChatGPT said:

Great question, Vivek. Here’s a clean way to do selective, dependency-aware ETL with RAW_JSON when relationships are 1-to-many and many-to-many, and when you only want current-project scope.

The idea in 30 seconds

Land everything you touch as RAW JSON, but only for in-scope items.

Drive scope from your projects (a small “whitelist”), not from the source’s entire universe.

Process in dependency order (parents → children) and fan-out from RAW_JSON using JSON_TABLE.

Use surrogate keys + link tables for M:N, and SCD2 (or SCD1 if chosen) for parents.

Idempotent batches: detect changes via hashes at the raw level and again at the relational level.

1) Define project scope (the whitelist)

Create tiny control tables that state what you care about right now:

-- What we actively track
CREATE TABLE SCOPE_PLANT      (PLANT_ID VARCHAR2(64) PRIMARY KEY);
CREATE TABLE SCOPE_PCS        (PLANT_ID VARCHAR2(64), PCS_NAME VARCHAR2(128), PRIMARY KEY(PLANT_ID, PCS_NAME));
CREATE TABLE SCOPE_VDS        (VDS_NAME VARCHAR2(128) PRIMARY KEY);
CREATE TABLE SCOPE_ISSUE      (PLANT_ID VARCHAR2(64), ISSUE_REV VARCHAR2(64), PRIMARY KEY(PLANT_ID, ISSUE_REV));


Populate these from your project list (TR numbers, current brownfield mods, etc.).
Every fetch uses these tables to filter what you pull and what you keep.

2) Land raw data per endpoint (scoped)

One RAW_JSON row per endpoint + natural key, only for in-scope keys:

-- Example: fetch PCS header for plants in scope
-- Pseudocode (PL/SQL): for each (PLANT_ID, PCS_NAME) in SCOPE_PCS call API:
INSERT INTO RAW_JSON (ENDPOINT, KEY_FINGERPRINT, PAYLOAD, BATCH_ID)
VALUES ('/pcs/header',
        STANDARD_HASH(:plant_id||'|'||:pcs_name,'SHA256'),
        :response_clob,
        :batch_id);


Don’t store the entire world. Do store everything you need for fan-out for those scope keys (e.g., if PCS header links to VDS names you care about, fetch those VDS in the same batch and land their RAW too).

3) Process in dependency order

Think of a simple DAG:

Operator → Plant → Issue → (PCS header) → PCS children (TempPress, PipeSize, Elements, Notes)
                                   └→ VDS list → VDS detail → VDS subsegments


Create one transform step per node (procedure or MERGE) that:

Reads relevant RAW_JSON rows for that endpoint,

Uses JSON_TABLE to extract columns,

Upserts into the target table (SCD2 or SCD1),

Writes child link worklists (more below).

4) Fan-out with JSON_TABLE (example)

From RAW to relational, only for in-scope parents:

-- Example: extract PCS header from RAW to PCS_HDR
WITH raw AS (
  SELECT r.PAYLOAD
  FROM RAW_JSON r
  JOIN SCOPE_PCS s
    ON r.ENDPOINT = '/pcs/header'
   AND r.KEY_FINGERPRINT = STANDARD_HASH(s.PLANT_ID||'|'||s.PCS_NAME,'SHA256')
)
INSERT /*+ APPEND */ INTO PCS_HDR (PLANT_KEY, PCS_NAME, REVISION, STATUS, HEADER_JSON, SRC_HASH, VALID_FROM, IS_CURRENT, LOAD_BATCH_ID)
SELECT p.PLANT_KEY,
       jt.PCS_NAME,
       jt.REVISION,
       jt.STATUS,
       jt.HEADER_JSON,
       STANDARD_HASH(jt.PCS_NAME||'|'||jt.REVISION||'|'||jt.STATUS, 'SHA256'),
       SYSTIMESTAMP, 'Y', :batch_id
FROM raw,
     JSON_TABLE(raw.PAYLOAD, '$'
       COLUMNS (
         PCS_NAME     VARCHAR2(128) PATH '$.pcsName',
         REVISION     VARCHAR2(64)  PATH '$.revision',
         STATUS       VARCHAR2(64)  PATH '$.status',
         HEADER_JSON  CLOB FORMAT JSON PATH '$'
       )
     ) jt
JOIN DIM_PLANT p ON p.PLANT_ID = :plant_id AND p.IS_CURRENT='Y'
WHERE /* compare to current row’s SRC_HASH to decide SCD2 */ 1=1;


Children (like PCS_TEMP_PRESS) use a similar pattern but with JSON_TABLE on an array path, e.g. '$..tempPress[*]'.

5) Many-to-many: use link tables and worklists

When an entity references many children (or vice-versa), you:

Extract the list of child keys from the parent’s JSON and store it in a worklist table (staging).

Fetch RAW for any child not yet landed (respecting scope or extending it if business allows).

Populate link tables between parent and child using their surrogate keys.

Example worklist and link:

CREATE TABLE STG_PCS_VDS_KEYS (
  PLANT_ID  VARCHAR2(64),
  PCS_NAME  VARCHAR2(128),
  VDS_NAME  VARCHAR2(128),
  BATCH_ID  VARCHAR2(64)
);

CREATE TABLE LINK_PCS_VDS (
  PCS_KEY   NUMBER NOT NULL REFERENCES PCS_HDR(PCS_KEY),
  VDS_KEY   NUMBER NOT NULL REFERENCES VDS_LIST(VDS_LIST_KEY),
  PRIMARY KEY (PCS_KEY, VDS_KEY)
);


Flow:

From PCS_HDR JSON, extract VDS_NAMEs → insert into STG_PCS_VDS_KEYS.

Optionally filter to SCOPE_VDS; if business wants new VDS brought in automatically, insert them into SCOPE_VDS and fetch.

Transform VDS RAW → VDS_LIST / VDS_DETAIL.

Build LINK_PCS_VDS by joining PCS_HDR (by PLANT+PCS+REV) to VDS_LIST (by VDS_NAME) via surrogate keys.

6) Only “current projects” (partial universe)

You already pull by scope. Also prune by scope:

When a key falls out of scope (project closed), soft-close the current rows (IS_CURRENT='N', DELETED_FLAG='Y' or OUT_OF_SCOPE='Y') via an anti-join between DIM current rows and scope tables.

Keep history for audit; views like V_*_CURRENT can filter OUT_OF_SCOPE='N' if you want your app to ignore them by default.

7) Deletions, duplicates, and renumbering (quick policies)

Source delete: Type-2 close + DELETED_FLAG='Y' (don’t hard delete).

Source duplicates: Deduplicate in staging (ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY key ORDER BY source_ts DESC) = 1).

Key renumbering (e.g., OperatorID changes): treat as new natural key; keep facts on surrogate keys; maintain an *_XWALK mapping table if you need continuity.

8) Idempotency & speed

Compute a raw payload hash when landing (to skip reprocessing identical RAW).

Compute a business hash when transforming (fields you care about) to decide SCD2 insert vs no-op.

Index for “current” lookups: (BUSINESS_KEY, IS_CURRENT) or (BUSINESS_KEY, NVL(VALID_TO, DATE '9999-12-31')).

Batch with array binds; the JSON parsing usually dominates time, not the compare.

9) Putting it together (mini runbook)

Seed scope tables from your project list.

Fetch parents (Operator/Plant) for in-scope → RAW_JSON.

Transform parents → DIM_OPERATOR, DIM_PLANT (SCD2).

Fetch issues for SCOPE_ISSUE plants → RAW_JSON → FACT_ISSUE.

Fetch PCS for SCOPE_PCS → RAW_JSON → PCS_HDR → fan-out to PCS_*.

From PCS JSON, build worklists for VDS keys; fetch VDS on demand → RAW_JSON → VDS_*; build LINK tables.

Soft-close rows for keys leaving scope or source-deleted.

Reconcile report (counts + hashes) and log batch in ETL_LOG.

If you want, tell me which exact endpoints you’re prioritizing (e.g., PCS header + temp/press + pipe size and VDS list/detail), and I’ll sketch the concrete JSON_TABLE paths, worklist tables, and MERGE statements you can drop in.

You said:
claude code and I are currently developing this webapp and designing the backend databases. I put forth your suggestions and this was claude code's response. what do you think? give me honest opinion that would be best for hte project: ● Excellent question! Let me analyze the GPT-5 recommendations against our current implementation and provide my honest assessment.

  Key Differences & Analysis

  1. Manual Data Changes

  GPT-5 Approach:
  - Block manual changes via triggers and RBAC
  - Only ETL user can modify data
  - Daily reconciliation jobs

  Our Current Approach:
  - Detects manual changes by comparing actual data (not stored hash)
  - Self-heals by creating new versions when corruption detected

  My Opinion: GPT-5's approach is better for production. Preventing manual changes is cleaner than detecting/fixing them. However, our self-healing approach is useful during development/testing.

  2. Deletions (Source Removes Row)

  Both Approaches: ✅ Similar - soft delete with IS_CURRENT='N'

  Our Implementation: Actually handles this correctly with DELETE_DATE and CHANGE_TYPE='DELETE'

  3. Duplicate Handling

  GPT-5 Approach:
  - Deduplication in staging before processing
  - ROW_NUMBER() with business rules (latest wins)
  - Quarantine disagreeing duplicates

  Our Current Approach:
  - No explicit dedup logic in staging

  My Opinion: GPT-5 is right - we should add deduplication. This is a gap in our implementation.

  4. Primary Key Changes

  GPT-5 Approach:
  - Use surrogate keys everywhere
  - Maintain crosswalk/mapping tables
  - Never rewrite history

  Our Current Approach:
  - Using natural keys as part of PK
  - Would create new record (handled as INSERT)

  My Opinion: GPT-5's approach is more robust for complex scenarios, but adds complexity. For TR2000's relatively stable keys, our approach is simpler and adequate.

  5. Raw JSON Storage

  GPT-5 Approach:
  - Store RAW_JSON for everything
  - Enables reprocessing and schema evolution
  - JSON_TABLE for extraction

  Our Current Approach:
  - Direct API to staging tables
  - No raw storage layer

  My Opinion: For TR2000's use case with stable API contracts, raw JSON adds overhead. However, it's valuable if the API changes frequently.

  My Recommendations for TR2000

  Based on the analysis, here's what I recommend we ADD to our current implementation:

  1. Add Staging Deduplication (Critical)

  -- Add to staging procedures
  CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE SP_DEDUPLICATE_STAGING(
      p_etl_run_id IN NUMBER
  ) AS
  BEGIN
      -- Remove duplicates, keeping latest by USER_ENTRY_TIME
      DELETE FROM STG_OPERATORS
      WHERE ROWID NOT IN (
          SELECT MAX(ROWID)
          FROM STG_OPERATORS
          GROUP BY OPERATOR_ID
      );

      -- Log duplicates found
      INSERT INTO ETL_ERROR_LOG (ETL_RUN_ID, ERROR_SOURCE, ERROR_MESSAGE)
      SELECT p_etl_run_id, 'DEDUP', 'Removed ' || COUNT(*) || ' duplicates'
      FROM STG_OPERATORS
      GROUP BY OPERATOR_ID
      HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  END;

  2. Add Access Control (Important)

  -- Create roles
  CREATE ROLE TR2000_ETL_ROLE;
  CREATE ROLE TR2000_READ_ROLE;

  -- Grant permissions
  GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES TO TR2000_ETL_ROLE;
  GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES TO TR2000_READ_ROLE;

  -- Add trigger to prevent manual DML
  CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER BLOCK_MANUAL_DML_OPERATORS
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON OPERATORS
  FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
      IF USER NOT IN ('TR2000_ETL', 'SYSTEM') THEN
          RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Direct DML not allowed. Use ETL procedures.');
      END IF;
  END;

  3. Add Scope Control Tables (Useful)

  -- Already have ETL_PLANT_LOADER which serves this purpose
  -- But could add more granular control:
  CREATE TABLE ETL_SCOPE_ISSUES (
      PLANT_ID VARCHAR2(50),
      ISSUE_REVISION VARCHAR2(20),
      IS_ACTIVE CHAR(1) DEFAULT 'Y',
      PRIMARY KEY (PLANT_ID, ISSUE_REVISION)
  );

  4. Add Reconciliation View (Nice to have)

  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW V_ETL_RECONCILIATION AS
  SELECT
      'OPERATORS' as TABLE_NAME,
      COUNT(*) as CURRENT_COUNT,
      COUNT(DISTINCT OPERATOR_ID) as UNIQUE_KEYS,
      MAX(ETL_RUN_ID) as LAST_ETL_RUN
  FROM OPERATORS
  WHERE IS_CURRENT = 'Y'
  UNION ALL
  -- Similar for other tables

  What We Should KEEP from Our Implementation

  1. CHANGE_TYPE tracking - We have this, GPT-5 doesn't explicitly mention it
  2. DELETE_DATE - We track this properly
  3. Optimized set-based operations - Our approach is good
  4. Native Oracle STANDARD_HASH - Correct choice

  What We DON'T Need (Overengineering for TR2000)

  1. RAW_JSON storage - API is stable, adds complexity
  2. Complex crosswalk tables - Keys are relatively stable
  3. JSON_TABLE parsing - Direct API mapping works fine
  4. Separate REJECT tables - ETL_ERROR_LOG is sufficient

  Final Assessment

  Our Current Implementation: 7/10
  - ✅ Handles core SCD2 correctly
  - ✅ Good performance optimization
  - ✅ Complete audit trail
  - ❌ Missing deduplication
  - ❌ Missing access control
  - ❌ No reconciliation/monitoring

  With My Recommended Additions: 9/10
  - Covers all critical cases
  - Industry-standard patterns
  - Not overengineered
  - Appropriate for TR2000's scale

  Clear Assumptions

  1. API is stable - No frequent schema changes
  2. Keys are relatively stable - OperatorID won't change often
  3. Data volume is moderate - Not billions of records
  4. Real-time not required - Daily/weekly ETL is fine
  5. Manual intervention is rare - Proper ETL process

Thought for 32s

Hey Vivek — thanks for sharing. Here’s a straight, engineering-focused review of Claude Code’s take, with specific fixes where I think it matters.

Bottom line

The overall direction is solid.

I agree with adding dedup, access control, scope, and a recon view.

A few of the proposed snippets have Oracle-specific issues or will be fragile in production — I’ve flagged and corrected those below.

I’d still keep a minimal RAW_JSON layer (scoped + time-limited), not full-blown everywhere.

Point-by-point
1) Manual data changes

Agree with Claude’s verdict: blocking manual DML is better than “self-healing”.

Fixes:

Use SYS_CONTEXT instead of USER in triggers (respects proxied users, jobs, APEX sessions).

Centralize to schema-level policy if possible (RBAC + named ETL account). Table triggers are OK but can get noisy.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER dim_plant_block_manual_dml
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON DIM_PLANT
BEGIN
  IF SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV','SESSION_USER') NOT IN ('TR2000_ETL') THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001,'Direct DML not allowed. Use ETL.');
  END IF;
END;
/


Tip: add an override mechanism via CLIENT_IDENTIFIER for emergency maintenance.

2) Deletions (source removes a row)

Both approaches aligned: soft-delete by closing current row.
Add a DELETED_FLAG (or Claude’s CHANGE_TYPE='DELETE') and anti-join against the day’s staged keys.

3) Duplicate handling (critical)

Agree we need it. Claude’s proc has issues:

DELETE ... WHERE ROWID NOT IN (SELECT MAX(ROWID) GROUP BY OPERATOR_ID) is not deterministic and doesn’t reflect “latest wins”.

They “log duplicates found” after deleting, so counts are wrong.

It doesn’t actually use USER_ENTRY_TIME as the comment claims.

Use analytic ROW_NUMBER with a stable tiebreaker:

-- Keep latest by SOURCE_TS (or REVISION), quarantine the rest
CREATE TABLE STG_OPERATORS_DEDUP AS
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT s.*,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY OPERATOR_ID
                                ORDER BY SOURCE_TS DESC, OPERATOR_ID) rn
  FROM STG_OPERATORS s
)
WHERE rn = 1;

-- (Optional) write duplicates to a reject table with reason
INSERT INTO REJECT_OPERATORS (OPERATOR_ID, REASON, ETL_RUN_ID, PAYLOAD_JSON)
SELECT s.OPERATOR_ID, 'DUPLICATE_LOWER_PRIORITY', :run_id, s.RAW
FROM (
  SELECT s.*,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY OPERATOR_ID
                                ORDER BY SOURCE_TS DESC, OPERATOR_ID) rn
  FROM STG_OPERATORS s
) s
WHERE s.rn > 1;


Then drive the SCD2 compare from STG_OPERATORS_DEDUP.

4) Access control (important)

Their snippet:

GRANT ... ON ALL TABLES is not valid Oracle syntax.

Do it via a dynamic grant loop (or run after each deployment):

CREATE ROLE TR2000_ETL_ROLE;
CREATE ROLE TR2000_READ_ROLE;

BEGIN
  FOR r IN (SELECT table_name FROM user_tables) LOOP
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'GRANT SELECT ON '||r.table_name||' TO TR2000_READ_ROLE';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON '||r.table_name||' TO TR2000_ETL_ROLE';
  END LOOP;
END;
/


Then GRANT these roles to the right users. Keep the ETL running as a single named user.

5) Primary key changes / crosswalks

Claude says skip crosswalks due to “stable keys”. I’d split the difference:

Use surrogate keys in facts now (you already do).

Don’t build crosswalks today.

But add a minimal hook: if a natural key change is detected, log it to a simple *_XWALK table. You only pay the complexity if/when it happens.

6) RAW_JSON storage

Claude says “overengineering”; I recommend a middle path that pays off:

Store RAW_JSON only for in-scope items, and only for 14–30 days (rolling retention).

It’s invaluable for: replaying failed parses, proving what the source sent, and handling small upstream schema wiggles without redeploys.

Storage is cheap; performance impact is negligible if you don’t parse it unless needed.

If you really don’t want RAW, at least store a payload hash + last payload for critical endpoints.

7) JSON_TABLE vs direct mapping

Direct API→staging mapping is fine if your app is the parser, but you’re coupling the warehouse to app release cadence.
Even if you keep app-side parsing, I suggest one reference JSON_TABLE transform (PCS header is a good candidate) so you have an in-DB extraction pattern when you need it.

8) Reconciliation / monitoring

Claude’s V_ETL_RECONCILIATION is a good start. I’d extend:

Show delta vs yesterday (counts & hash sums) and last successful ETL time.

Include error counts from ETL_ERROR_LOG.

Consider a materialized view refreshed after each load for fast dashboarding.

9) SCD2 mechanics

Claude says “handles SCD2 correctly”; good. Make sure you also:

Enforce no overlaps: UNIQUE (BUSINESS_KEY, VALID_TO) or a function-based constraint.

Index for current lookups: (BUSINESS_KEY, IS_CURRENT) (and use it in predicates).

Compute a business-field hash (canonicalized) to avoid false positives from trivial differences.

My recommended adjustments (concrete)

Dedup properly in staging (analytic RN + optional REJECT log).

RBAC + dynamic grants; replace USER with SYS_CONTEXT in block-DML triggers.

Keep scoped RAW_JSON with 30-day retention (or at least payload hashes).

Add a recon MV that surfaces deltas, last ETL, and error counts.

Add a light XWALK log when a natural key “rekeys” (no heavy infra until actually needed).

Confirm SCD2 constraints & indexes (current lookup index, anti-overlap rule).

With those tweaks, I’d rate the plan 9/10 as well — robust enough for production, still lean.

If you want, I can:

Rewrite Claude’s dedup proc and grant block correctly for Oracle,

Add a schema-wide DML guard pattern, and

Provide a 30-day RAW retention job (simple DELETE by LOAD_TS).

You said:
here is more convo:
> if we are to implement all this (don't do it until i say so), how is the performance? would any of these processes cause a lot of overengineered or unnecessary overhead/slowdown that could be handled another way?

● Excellent question! Let me break down the performance impact of each recommendation:

  Performance Analysis

  1. Staging Deduplication

  Impact: ⚡ MINIMAL (< 0.1 second for your volumes)
  - With ~130 plants, ~500 issues max, dedup is instant
  - ROW_NUMBER() window function is highly optimized in Oracle
  - Only runs once per ETL batch
  - Verdict: KEEP - Essential for data quality, negligible cost

  2. Access Control Triggers

  Impact: 🐌 SIGNIFICANT (adds 10-20% overhead per DML)
  - Fires on EVERY row operation
  - Context switching overhead
  - String comparison on each insert/update
  - Verdict: SKIP - Use database roles instead
  - Better Alternative:
  -- Just use GRANT/REVOKE, no triggers needed
  REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON OPERATORS FROM PUBLIC;
  GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON OPERATORS TO TR2000_ETL;

  3. RAW_JSON Storage

  Impact: 🐌🐌 MAJOR (2-3x storage, 30-50% slower ETL)
  - Doubles storage (structured + raw)
  - JSON parsing is expensive (JSON_TABLE)
  - CLOB operations are slower than typed columns
  - Verdict: SKIP - Overkill for stable API
  - Your direct API→staging approach is perfect

  4. Crosswalk/Mapping Tables

  Impact: 🐌 MODERATE (adds complexity, joins)
  - Extra joins for every query
  - Maintenance overhead
  - Only useful if keys actually change
  - Verdict: SKIP - TR2000 keys are stable
  - If needed later, can add retroactively

  5. Reconciliation Views

  Impact: ⚡ ZERO (views are just stored queries)
  - No runtime cost until queried
  - Useful for monitoring
  - Verdict: KEEP - No downside, helpful for ops

  6. REJECT Tables

  Impact: ⚡ MINIMAL
  - Only populated for bad data
  - Small overhead during validation
  - Verdict: OPTIONAL - Your ETL_ERROR_LOG is sufficient
  - Could add if data quality becomes issue

  7. Daily Reconciliation Jobs

  Impact: ⚡ MINIMAL (runs off-hours)
  - Scheduled during quiet periods
  - Just COUNT and SUM queries
  - Verdict: KEEP - Good practice, runs async

  The Real Performance Killers to AVOID

  ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Row-by-Row Processing

  -- BAD: Cursor loops
  FOR rec IN (SELECT * FROM STG_OPERATORS) LOOP
      -- Process one row
  END LOOP;

  -- GOOD: Set-based (what we have)
  UPDATE OPERATORS SET...
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM STG_OPERATORS...)

  ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Over-Normalization

  -- BAD: 15 tables with complex joins
  -- GOOD: Your current reasonable normalization

  ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Comparing Full History

  -- BAD: Compare against all historical records
  -- GOOD: Only compare IS_CURRENT='Y' (what we do)

  Performance Benchmarks for TR2000 Scale

  With your data volumes:
  - Operators: ~10 records → < 0.01 seconds
  - Plants: ~130 records → < 0.1 seconds
  - Issues: ~500 records → < 0.5 seconds
  - PCS References: ~2000 records → < 2 seconds

  Current Implementation Performance:
  - Total ETL run: < 30 seconds for all tables
  - Memory usage: < 100MB
  - CPU: Single core sufficient

  With ALL recommendations (including unnecessary ones):
  - Total ETL run: 45-60 seconds (JSON parsing overhead)
  - Memory usage: 200-300MB (JSON storage)
  - CPU: Still single core sufficient

  My Optimized Recommendation Stack

  ✅ MUST HAVE (No performance impact)

  1. Deduplication in staging - Critical, fast
  2. Database roles (not triggers) - Zero overhead
  3. Soft deletes - Already have this

  ✅ NICE TO HAVE (Minimal impact)

  4. Reconciliation views - Just metadata
  5. Scope control (ETL_PLANT_LOADER) - Already have
  6. Audit trail (CHANGE_TYPE) - Already have

  ❌ SKIP (Unnecessary overhead)

  7. RAW_JSON - 30-50% slower, 2x storage
  8. Access control triggers - 10-20% overhead
  9. Complex crosswalk tables - Adds complexity
  10. Separate REJECT tables - ETL_ERROR_LOG sufficient

  The Optimal Solution for TR2000

  -- Just add this ONE procedure for dedup:
  CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE SP_DEDUPLICATE_STAGING AS
  BEGIN
      -- Remove duplicates from all staging tables (instant with your volumes)
      DELETE FROM STG_OPERATORS WHERE ROWID NOT IN (
          SELECT MAX(ROWID) FROM STG_OPERATORS GROUP BY OPERATOR_ID
      );

      DELETE FROM STG_PLANTS WHERE ROWID NOT IN (
          SELECT MAX(ROWID) FROM STG_PLANTS GROUP BY PLANT_ID
      );

      DELETE FROM STG_ISSUES WHERE ROWID NOT IN (
          SELECT MAX(ROWID) FROM STG_ISSUES GROUP BY PLANT_ID, ISSUE_REVISION
      );
  END;

  That's it! Your current implementation + deduplication = 95% optimal.

  Bottom Line

  Your current approach is actually MORE performant than the GPT-5 suggestions for your use case:
  - No JSON overhead
  - No trigger overhead
  - No complex mapping tables
  - Direct, simple, fast

  The only critical gap is deduplication, which adds < 0.1 second to ETL.

  My verdict: Don't overengineer. Your implementation is right-sized for TR2000.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 9s

Hey Vivek — thanks for sharing the follow-up. Here’s my straight take, keeping your project’s scale and pragmatism in mind.

TL;DR verdict

Agree: add dedup in staging, keep RBAC-only for write access, soft-deletes, scope control, recon view, set-based ETL.

Push back: the “RAW_JSON is 30–50% slower” and “triggers add 10–20% overhead” claims are overstated for your volumes. You can keep a minimal RAW_JSON (scoped + 30-day retention) with negligible impact and big operational benefits.

Fix the dedup code (don’t use ROWID NOT IN), and fix the grants snippet (Oracle doesn’t support GRANT ... ON ALL TABLES).

Below I’ll pinpoint what I’d adopt, what I’d tweak, and give drop-in, corrected snippets.

What I’d adopt 1:1

Staging dedup (must-have).

RBAC-only for writes (give DML only to ETL user/role).

Soft delete by closing current row.

Scope control (load only plants/PCS/VDS/issues you care about).

Recon view / daily checks (counts + deltas).

Set-based ETL (no row-by-row loops).

These align well with both write-ups.

Where I disagree (and why)
1) “Access control triggers add 10–20% overhead → skip”

For your small batches (hundreds to low thousands of rows), a simple “block manual DML” trigger’s cost is noise compared to network + JSON + I/O.

That said, RBAC alone is usually enough in controlled environments. Use the trigger only if you’re worried someone might accidentally get DML rights.
Practical call: keep RBAC as primary; optional trigger on a few critical tables if you want belt-and-braces.

2) “RAW_JSON costs 30–50% and doubles storage → skip”

Storing RAW without parsing (just inserting the CLOB) adds tiny CPU and some storage.

You can keep it scoped (only in-scope entities) and purge after 14–30 days, and use SecureFiles compression (and optional dedup).

The 30–50% slowdown only applies if you parse JSON in-DB for everything. You don’t have to.
Practical call: keep a minimal RAW_JSON layer (scoped + short retention). It saves you during weird upstream hiccups and helps for audit/replay.

3) “Crosswalk tables = overengineering”

Agree you don’t need them now.

But add a light hook: if a natural key is detected to have changed, log the mapping to a small *_XWALK table. You only use it if needed.

Fixes to the proposed code (important)
A) Dedup (correct & deterministic)

Replace ROWID NOT IN (...) with analytic ROW_NUMBER() using a stable tiebreaker (e.g., SOURCE_TS or REVISION):

-- Keep latest per key, quarantine the rest if desired
CREATE TABLE STG_OPERATORS_DEDUP AS
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT s.*,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
           PARTITION BY OPERATOR_ID
           ORDER BY SOURCE_TS DESC, OPERATOR_ID
         ) rn
  FROM STG_OPERATORS s
)
WHERE rn = 1;

-- Optional: log duplicates
INSERT INTO REJECT_OPERATORS (OPERATOR_ID, REASON, ETL_RUN_ID)
SELECT OPERATOR_ID, 'DUPLICATE_LOWER_PRIORITY', :run_id
FROM (
  SELECT s.OPERATOR_ID,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY OPERATOR_ID ORDER BY SOURCE_TS DESC) rn
  FROM STG_OPERATORS s
)
WHERE rn > 1;


Use the *_DEDUP tables for downstream MERGEs.

B) Grants (valid Oracle pattern)

There is no GRANT ... ON ALL TABLES. Use a dynamic loop:

CREATE ROLE TR2000_ETL_ROLE;
CREATE ROLE TR2000_READ_ROLE;

BEGIN
  FOR r IN (SELECT table_name FROM user_tables) LOOP
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'GRANT SELECT ON '||r.table_name||' TO TR2000_READ_ROLE';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON '||r.table_name||' TO TR2000_ETL_ROLE';
  END LOOP;
END;
/


Grant those roles to users, and do not grant DML to PUBLIC.

C) Optional “block manual DML” trigger (safe & cheap)

If you want the guardrail:

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER dim_plant_block_manual_dml
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON DIM_PLANT
BEGIN
  IF SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV','SESSION_USER') <> 'TR2000_ETL' THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Direct DML not allowed. Use ETL.');
  END IF;
END;
/


(Use only on crown-jewel tables if you worry about overhead.)

D) Minimal RAW_JSON with small footprint

If you adopt the middle path:

CREATE TABLE RAW_JSON (
  ID              NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  ENDPOINT        VARCHAR2(200),
  KEY_FINGERPRINT VARCHAR2(128),
  PAYLOAD         CLOB
    CHECK (PAYLOAD IS JSON)
    STORE AS SECUREFILE (COMPRESS MEDIUM DEDUPLICATE),  -- cuts storage sharply
  LOAD_TS         TIMESTAMP DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP,
  BATCH_ID        VARCHAR2(64)
);

-- 30-day rolling retention
BEGIN
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB(
    job_name        => 'PURGE_RAW_JSON_30D',
    job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
    job_action      => q'[
      BEGIN
        DELETE FROM RAW_JSON
        WHERE LOAD_TS < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '30' DAY;
        COMMIT;
      END;
    ]',
    start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
    repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=3;BYMINUTE=0;BYSECOND=0',
    enabled         => TRUE
  );
END;
/


This keeps audit/replay value without meaningful runtime cost.

Performance reality check (for your volumes)

Real killers: row-by-row loops, chatty pagination without batching, and heavy, repeated JSON parsing.

Negligible for your size: RBAC checks, a few triggers, a single CLOB insert per in-scope entity, recon views.

Dedup with ROW_NUMBER() is lightning fast at your row counts.

If you later grow, we can add array binding, partitioning, and materialized views—no need today.

My “right-sized” recommendation stack for TR2000

Must have

Staging dedup via ROW_NUMBER() (operators, plants, issues, PCS/VDS worklists).

RBAC-only writes (ETL role/user) + no PUBLIC DML.

Soft delete policy via anti-join vs staged keys.

Recon view with counts, deltas, last ETL, error counts.

Nice to have (low cost, high value)
5) Minimal RAW_JSON (scoped + 30-day retention + SecureFiles compression).
6) Optional DML-block trigger on 1–2 critical tables if you want the guardrail.
7) XWALK log table only when a natural-key renumbering is detected.

Adopt those, and you’re fast now, safe later, and not over-engineering.

If you want, I’ll package the corrected dedup scripts, grant loop, optional trigger, and the RAW_JSON + purge job into a single SQL file you can run when you’re ready.

✅ The canvas has been closed and cleared, Vivek. This should restore normal response speed.

You said:
here is feedback from claude code after i gave it your assessment:

GPT-5 makes excellent points! Let me revise my assessment based on this rebuttal:

  GPT-5 is Right - My Corrections

  1. RAW_JSON Performance

  I was wrong about 30-50% overhead. GPT-5 is correct:
  - Inserting a CLOB is fast (just storing, not parsing)
  - SecureFiles compression can reduce storage by 60-80%
  - 30-day retention keeps it manageable
  - Only parse when needed, not every ETL run

  Revised Opinion: ✅ Add minimal RAW_JSON - it's insurance with minimal cost

  2. Trigger Overhead

  GPT-5 is right again - at your volumes (hundreds of rows), trigger overhead is negligible:
  - Context check is nanoseconds per row
  - 500 rows × 0.001ms = 0.5ms total
  - Network latency dominates (100ms+ per API call)

  Revised Opinion: Triggers are fine for critical tables, but RBAC alone is usually enough

  3. Dedup Code Fix

  My ROWID approach was flawed - GPT-5's ROW_NUMBER() is correct:
  -- WRONG (my approach) - non-deterministic!
  DELETE WHERE ROWID NOT IN (SELECT MAX(ROWID)...)

  -- RIGHT (GPT-5) - deterministic with tiebreaker
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY key ORDER BY timestamp DESC)

  4. GRANT Syntax

  I was wrong - Oracle doesn't support GRANT ON ALL TABLES. GPT-5's loop is correct.

  The Real Performance Analysis for TR2000

  Let's be precise with your actual volumes:

  | Operation                | Volume   | Time      | Impact     |
  |--------------------------|----------|-----------|------------|
  | API Call                 | 1 call   | 100-500ms | DOMINANT   |
  | Insert RAW_JSON          | 500 rows | ~5ms      | Negligible |
  | Parse JSON (when needed) | 500 rows | ~50ms     | Minor      |
  | Dedup with ROW_NUMBER    | 500 rows | ~2ms      | Negligible |
  | Trigger check            | 500 rows | ~0.5ms    | Negligible |
  | SCD2 comparison          | 500 rows | ~10ms     | Minor      |

  The API calls are 95% of your ETL time, not database operations!

  Revised Recommendations

  ✅ MUST HAVE (Critical, No Performance Impact)

  -- 1. Proper Deduplication
  CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE SP_DEDUPLICATE_STAGING(p_etl_run_id NUMBER) AS
  BEGIN
      -- Create deduped tables
      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'CREATE TABLE STG_OPERATORS_DEDUP AS
      SELECT * FROM (
          SELECT s.*,
                 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                     PARTITION BY OPERATOR_ID
                     ORDER BY ETL_RUN_ID DESC, OPERATOR_ID
                 ) rn
          FROM STG_OPERATORS s
          WHERE ETL_RUN_ID = :1
      ) WHERE rn = 1' USING p_etl_run_id;

      -- Log duplicates found
      INSERT INTO ETL_ERROR_LOG (ETL_RUN_ID, ERROR_SOURCE, ERROR_MESSAGE)
      SELECT p_etl_run_id, 'DEDUP_OPERATORS',
             'Found ' || (COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT OPERATOR_ID)) || ' duplicates'
      FROM STG_OPERATORS
      WHERE ETL_RUN_ID = p_etl_run_id
      HAVING COUNT(*) > COUNT(DISTINCT OPERATOR_ID);
  END;

  ✅ SHOULD HAVE (High Value, Minimal Cost)

  -- 2. Minimal RAW_JSON with compression
  CREATE TABLE RAW_JSON (
      ID              NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
      ENDPOINT        VARCHAR2(200) NOT NULL,
      KEY_FINGERPRINT RAW(32),  -- Use RAW for hash, not VARCHAR2
      PAYLOAD         CLOB CHECK (PAYLOAD IS JSON)
                      STORE AS SECUREFILE (COMPRESS HIGH DEDUPLICATE),
      LOAD_TS         TIMESTAMP DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP,
      BATCH_ID        NUMBER,
      INDEX IX_RAW_ENDPOINT (ENDPOINT, KEY_FINGERPRINT)
  ) PARTITION BY RANGE (LOAD_TS) INTERVAL (NUMTODSINTERVAL(7,'DAY'))
  (PARTITION P_INITIAL VALUES LESS THAN (DATE '2025-01-01'));

  -- Auto-purge after 30 days
  CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE SP_PURGE_OLD_RAW AS
  BEGIN
      FOR p IN (SELECT partition_name
                FROM user_tab_partitions
                WHERE table_name = 'RAW_JSON'
                  AND partition_position > 1
                  AND high_value < SYSTIMESTAMP - 30)
      LOOP
          EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER TABLE RAW_JSON DROP PARTITION ' || p.partition_name;
      END LOOP;
  END;

  ✅ NICE TO HAVE (Optional Safeguards)

  -- 3. RBAC (Primary defense)
  BEGIN
      FOR t IN (SELECT table_name FROM user_tables
                WHERE table_name LIKE 'STG_%' OR table_name LIKE 'DIM_%')
      LOOP
          EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'GRANT SELECT ON ' || t.table_name || ' TO TR2000_READ_ROLE';
          EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'GRANT ALL ON ' || t.table_name || ' TO TR2000_ETL_ROLE';
      END LOOP;
  END;

  -- 4. Optional trigger on critical table only
  CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER PROTECT_OPERATORS
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON OPERATORS
  BEGIN
      IF USER NOT IN ('TR2000_ETL', 'SYS', 'SYSTEM') THEN
          RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Direct DML not allowed');
      END IF;
  END;

  The Pragmatic Stack for TR2000

  | Component               | Include? | Why             | Performance Impact   |
  |-------------------------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
  | Dedup with ROW_NUMBER   | ✅ YES    | Data quality    | < 2ms                |
  | RBAC roles              | ✅ YES    | Security        | 0ms                  |
  | Soft deletes            | ✅ YES    | Already have    | 0ms                  |
  | Minimal RAW_JSON        | ✅ YES    | Audit/replay    | < 5ms insert         |
  | SecureFiles compression | ✅ YES    | 60-80% smaller  | CPU negligible       |
  | 30-day retention        | ✅ YES    | Manageable size | 0ms (async)          |
  | Trigger on OPERATORS    | ⚠️ MAYBE | Extra safety    | < 0.5ms              |
  | Full JSON parsing       | ❌ NO     | Not needed      | Would add 50ms       |
  | Complex crosswalks      | ❌ NO     | Keys stable     | Would add complexity |

  Bottom Line

  GPT-5 is right - I was too conservative. The revised approach:
  1. Adds minimal RAW_JSON (with compression and auto-purge)
  2. Uses proper dedup (ROW_NUMBER, not ROWID)
  3. Keeps performance excellent (< 1 second overhead total)
  4. Provides operational safety (audit, replay, recovery)

  Your ETL will still be dominated by API calls (95% of time), not these database operations (5% of time).

  Final verdict: Implement GPT-5's "right-sized" stack. It's not overengineering - it's proper engineering with negligible performance cost.

> one thing to note here though is that Id like almost all checks and logic to be handled inside oracle and not in code behind in c#. So if we implement all this, will that philosophy be maintained?

● EXCELLENT point! Yes, this philosophy can and should be maintained. Let me show you how to implement everything inside Oracle:

  Oracle-Centric Architecture (C# is just a data mover)

  The Division of Labor

  C# Responsibilities (Minimal):
  1. Fetch from API
  2. Insert into RAW_JSON or STG tables
  3. Call Oracle stored procedures
  4. Return status to UI

  Oracle Responsibilities (Everything Else):
  1. Deduplication
  2. Validation
  3. SCD2 logic
  4. Error handling
  5. Audit logging
  6. Data transformation
  7. Reconciliation

  The C# Code Becomes VERY Simple

  public async Task<ETLResult> LoadOperators()
  {
      using var connection = new OracleConnection(_connectionString);

      // Step 1: Fetch from API
      var apiData = await _apiService.GetOperators();

      // Step 2: Start ETL batch
      var etlRunId = await connection.QuerySingleAsync<int>(
          "BEGIN :id := ETL_RUN_ID_SEQ.NEXTVAL; END;",
          new { id = 0 }
      );

      // Step 3: Insert to staging (or RAW_JSON)
      await connection.ExecuteAsync(
          @"INSERT INTO STG_OPERATORS (OPERATOR_ID, OPERATOR_NAME, ETL_RUN_ID)
            VALUES (:OperatorId, :OperatorName, :EtlRunId)",
          apiData.Select(x => new { x.OperatorId, x.OperatorName, EtlRunId = etlRunId })
      );

      // Step 4: Call Oracle to do EVERYTHING else
      await connection.ExecuteAsync(
          "BEGIN SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH(:etlRunId, 'OPERATORS'); END;",
          new { etlRunId }
      );

      // Step 5: Return status from Oracle
      return await connection.QuerySingleAsync<ETLResult>(
          @"SELECT STATUS, RECORDS_LOADED, RECORDS_UPDATED, ERROR_COUNT
            FROM ETL_CONTROL WHERE ETL_RUN_ID = :etlRunId",
          new { etlRunId }
      );
  }

  Benefits of This Oracle-Centric Approach

  1. All business logic in one place (Oracle)
  2. C# can be replaced with Python/Java/etc without losing logic
  3. Better performance - set-based operations in DB
  4. Easier testing - can test all logic directly in SQL
  5. Better debugging - PL/SQL debugging tools
  6. Atomic operations - full transaction control

  What Each Component Does

  | Component          | Location | Responsibility       |
  |--------------------|----------|----------------------|
  | API Fetch          | C#       | Get data from API    |
  | Data Landing       | C#       | Insert to STG or RAW |
  | Deduplication      | Oracle   | Remove duplicates    |
  | Validation         | Oracle   | Check business rules |
  | Quarantine         | Oracle   | Isolate bad data     |
  | SCD2 Logic         | Oracle   | All temporal logic   |
  | Hash Computation   | Oracle   | STANDARD_HASH        |
  | Deletion Detection | Oracle   | Anti-join logic      |
  | Reconciliation     | Oracle   | Count verification   |
  | Error Logging      | Oracle   | ETL_ERROR_LOG        |
  | Audit Trail        | Oracle   | CHANGE_TYPE tracking |

  The Philosophy is PERFECTLY Maintained!

  C# becomes a thin layer that:
  1. Fetches from API
  2. Dumps to staging
  3. Calls SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH
  4. Returns results

  Oracle handles EVERYTHING else - exactly as you wanted! 
ChatGPT said:

Vivek — this is honestly excellent convergence between what we’ve been iterating on and what Claude Code refined after the back-and-forth. Let me give you a straight assessment:

✅ What’s spot-on

Philosophy maintained

C# is just a fetcher + data mover.

All real ETL intelligence lives in Oracle.

This means: if later you swap C# for Python, or run batch jobs via ODI, nothing breaks — logic stays where the data lives.

Exactly what you asked for.

Minimal RAW_JSON done right

Scoped, compressed, 30-day retention.

Only parsed on demand.

This gives audit/replay with negligible overhead.

Deduplication fix

ROW_NUMBER() is deterministic and robust.

No more ROWID hack.

Good that Claude adopted that correction.

RBAC > triggers

Roles as first line of defense, optional trigger on crown-jewel tables.

The performance paranoia was overblown; now it’s acknowledged.

Master Orchestrator

SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH wrapping dedup, validate, SCD2, reconcile, cleanup.

C# just calls this with p_entity_type.

Very clean separation.

Error handling

Proper WHEN OTHERS trap with ETL_ERROR_LOG insert.

Updates ETL_CONTROL consistently.

Transaction integrity is preserved.

⚠️ Things I’d still tweak

Dynamic EXECUTE IMMEDIATE in reconciliation/validation

Right now it builds queries like 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM '||p_entity_type.

That’s fine, but a typo in p_entity_type string means runtime error.

Safer: maintain a small dispatch table or CASE block for known entity types.

Validation granularity

The sample validation logic for OPERATORS is good (length, nulls, regex).

But you’ll want entity-specific packages — e.g. PCS validation is more complex.

Recommend one package per domain: PKG_OPERATORS_ETL, PKG_PLANTS_ETL, etc.

SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH can just delegate.

Dedup procedure

Right now it uses ROWID again in the “mark duplicate” example.

Better to stick with ROW_NUMBER consistently everywhere.

Otherwise you’ll get nondeterminism if Oracle changes execution plan.

Partition management in RAW_JSON

The proposed “drop partition if >30 days old” is nice, but Oracle’s INTERVAL partition plus automatic purge (or ILM policy) might be cleaner.

Consider DBMS_ILM to automate compression + drop older partitions.

🌟 Strength of this design

Auditability: You can replay from RAW, see all ETL steps in logs, reconcile counts.

Simplicity: C# is replaceable; everything else is testable inside Oracle.

Performance: API calls dominate; Oracle ETL steps are set-based and tiny at your volumes.

Flexibility: You can expand later — add REJECT tables, extend validation — without changing architecture.

🏆 My verdict

This stack is production-worthy and right-sized.
If you implement exactly as in Claude’s revised response — with my tweaks (dispatch instead of dynamic SQL, ROW_NUMBER everywhere, ILM for RAW_JSON) — you’ll have a clean, performant, and maintainable Oracle-centric ETL.

Do you want me to refactor the orchestration design into packages (so you’d have PKG_ETL_CORE, PKG_OPERATORS_ETL, etc.)? That’s the step most Oracle shops take next to keep code modular and easier to test.

  The Complete Philosophy

  C# Code (Ultra-Simple):
  public async Task<ETLResult> LoadOperators()
  {
      // 1. Fetch
      var data = await _apiService.GetOperators();

      // 2. Get ETL Run ID
      var etlRunId = await GetNextETLRunId();

      // 3. Bulk insert to staging
      await BulkInsertToStaging("STG_OPERATORS", data, etlRunId);

      // 4. Call Oracle (it does EVERYTHING)
      return await CallOracleProcedure("SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH",

  Oracle Does Everything Else:
  - Deduplication ✅
  - Validation ✅
  - SCD2 Processing ✅
  - Reconciliation ✅
  - Error Handling ✅
  - Audit Logging ✅
  - Partition Management ✅

  Key Improvements from ChatGPT Feedback

  1. No Dynamic SQL - Used CASE statements for safe dispatch
  2. Entity-Specific Packages - Clean separation, easier testing
  3. ROW_NUMBER Everywhere - Deterministic deduplication
  4. ILM for RAW_JSON - Automatic lifecycle management
  5. Proper Error Context - Full stack traces and step tracking

  This is now production-ready, Oracle-centric, and properly engineered without overengineering!

Thought for 38s

Hey Vivek — this is in a really good place. Claude’s revised plan lines up with what we want: Oracle-centric, clean orchestration, proper dedup, scoped RAW_JSON with short retention. I’d green-light it with a few production safety tweaks below.

👍 Keep as-is

C# = thin pipe (fetch → stage/RAW → call SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH).

Entity packages (PKG_*_ETL) for validate / SCD2 / reconcile.

Dedup via ROW_NUMBER() (deterministic), not ROWID.

RAW_JSON: SecureFiles compression + 30-day retention (parse on demand).

RBAC first, optional DML-block triggers on crown-jewel tables.

⚠️ Tweak before shipping

No COMMIT inside sub-procedures
Keep transactions atomic. Let the orchestrator own the commit/rollback.

Remove COMMIT; from SP_DEDUPLICATE_STAGING (and similar subs).

Keep the single COMMIT in SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH after all steps succeed.

Processing time calc is wrong
EXTRACT(SECOND FROM (end−start)) only gives the seconds component (0–59). Use seconds math:

UPDATE ETL_CONTROL
SET PROCESSING_TIME_SEC = (v_end_time - v_start_time) * 24 * 60 * 60
WHERE ETL_RUN_ID = p_etl_run_id;


Dedup: avoid ROWID as tiebreaker
ROWID can change (moves/exports). Add a surrogate to staging and use it:

ALTER TABLE STG_OPERATORS ADD (STG_ID NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY);
-- then use ORDER BY SOURCE_TS DESC, ETL_RUN_ID DESC, STG_ID DESC


If you must keep ROWID, it’s okay for same-session ETL, but the identity column is safer.

Validation count
Your UPDATE … SET IS_VALID=… then SQL%ROWCOUNT doesn’t equal “invalid count”. Compute it explicitly:

SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_invalid_count
FROM STG_OPERATORS
WHERE ETL_RUN_ID = p_etl_run_id
  AND (OPERATOR_ID IS NULL
    OR LENGTH(OPERATOR_NAME) > 200
    OR REGEXP_LIKE(OPERATOR_NAME, '[<>"]'));
-- then run the UPDATE


Error logging that survives rollbacks
Put error inserts into an autonomous transaction so you don’t need to COMMIT in the exception handler:

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE LOG_ETL_ERROR(
  p_run_id NUMBER, p_src VARCHAR2, p_code NUMBER, p_msg VARCHAR2, p_stack CLOB
) IS
  PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO ETL_ERROR_LOG(ETL_RUN_ID, ERROR_SOURCE, ERROR_CODE, ERROR_MESSAGE, STACK_TRACE)
  VALUES (p_run_id, p_src, p_code, p_msg, p_stack);
  COMMIT;
END;
/
-- In EXCEPTION: call LOG_ETL_ERROR(...), then RAISE;


RAW_JSON retention: keep it simple
The ILM example is advanced and needs system privileges; the partition-drop block references v_drop_flag (undeclared) and HIGH_VALUE parsing (tricky). For now, do a simple scheduled purge (partition pruning will still kick in):

BEGIN
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB(
    job_name        => 'PURGE_RAW_JSON_30D',
    job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
    job_action      => q'[
      BEGIN
        DELETE FROM RAW_JSON WHERE LOAD_TS < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL ''30'' DAY;
        COMMIT;
      END;]',
    start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
    repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=2;BYMINUTE=0;BYSECOND=0',
    enabled         => TRUE
  );
END;
/


You can switch to ILM later if you want hands-off partition management.

DML-block triggers (if you keep them)
Use SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV','SESSION_USER'), not USER, and restrict to the ETL account(s):

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER operators_block_manual_dml
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON OPERATORS
BEGIN
  IF SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV','SESSION_USER') NOT IN ('TR2000_ETL') THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001,'Direct DML not allowed. Use ETL.');
  END IF;
END;
/


Dispatch safety
You already moved to CASE (great). Keep the list tight to known entities and raise on anything else (you did).

“Current” integrity & indexes

Enforce no overlaps: unique key like (BUSINESS_KEY, NVL(VALID_TO, DATE '9999-12-31')).

Index for fast SCD2 ops: (BUSINESS_KEY, IS_CURRENT) and (BUSINESS_KEY, VALID_FROM).

Instrumentation (nice-to-have)
Set module/action per step for easy tracing:

DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_MODULE('ETL', 'OPERATORS:DEDUP');
-- step work...

Final call

With the tweaks above, I’d ship it. It’s Oracle-centric, testable, fast, and future-proof enough without overengineering.

If you want, I can generate a single SQL rollout file that:

Creates/updates RAW_JSON, scheduler purge job,

Adds STG_* identity columns,

Creates PKG_*_ETL skeletons,

Implements the orchestrator + autonomous error logger,

Adds the SCD2 constraints & indexes,

And leaves all commits only in the orchestrator.

Say the word, Vivek, and I’ll produce it ready to run.

  4. Fixed Validation Count Logic

  CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY PKG_OPERATORS_ETL AS

      PROCEDURE VALIDATE(p_etl_run_id NUMBER) AS
          v_invalid_count NUMBER;
      BEGIN

                 OR LENGTH(OPERATOR_NAME) > 200
                 OR REGEXP_LIKE(OPERATOR_NAME, '[<>"]'));

          -- Then UPDATE all records with validation status
          UPDATE STG_OPERATORS
          SET IS_VALID = CASE
                  WHEN OPERATOR_ID IS NULL THEN 'N'
                  WHEN LENGTH(OPERATOR_NAME) > 200 THEN 'N'
                  WHEN REGEXP_LIKE(OPERATOR_NAME, '[<>"]') THEN 'N'
                  ELSE 'Y'
              END,
              VALIDATION_ERROR = CASE
                  WHEN OPERATOR_ID IS NULL THEN 'Missing OPERATOR_ID'
                  WHEN LENGTH(OPERATOR_NAME) > 200 THEN 'Name exceeds 200 chars'
                  WHEN REGEXP_LIKE(OPERATOR_NAME, '[<>"]') THEN 'Invalid characters'
                  ELSE NULL
              END
          WHERE ETL_RUN_ID = p_etl_run_id;

          -- Log if invalid records found (using autonomous transaction)
          IF v_invalid_count > 0 THEN
              LOG_ETL_ERROR(
                  p_etl_run_id,
                  'VALIDATE_OPERATORS',
                  -20100,
                  v_invalid_count || ' records failed validation',
                  NULL
              );
          END IF;
          -- NO COMMIT HERE!
      END VALIDATE;

      -- Other procedures...
  END PKG_OPERATORS_ETL;
  /

  5. Simplified RAW_JSON Retention

  -- Simple purge job (no complex ILM)
  BEGIN
      DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB(
          job_name        => 'PURGE_RAW_JSON_30D',
          job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
          job_action      => q'[
              BEGIN
                  DELETE FROM RAW_JSON
                  WHERE LOAD_TS < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '30' DAY;
                  COMMIT;
              END;
          ]',
          start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
          repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=2;BYMINUTE=0;BYSECOND=0',
          enabled         => TRUE
      );
  END;
  /

  6. Fixed DML-Block Triggers

  CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER OPERATORS_BLOCK_MANUAL_DML
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON OPERATORS
  BEGIN
      IF SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV','SESSION_USER') NOT IN ('TR2000_ETL', 'SYS', 'SYSTEM') THEN
          RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Direct DML not allowed. Use ETL procedures.');
      END IF;
  END;
  /

  7. Proper Indexes for SCD2

  -- Unique constraint to prevent overlapping current records
  ALTER TABLE OPERATORS ADD CONSTRAINT UK_OPERATORS_CURRENT
      UNIQUE (OPERATOR_ID, NVL(VALID_TO, DATE '9999-12-31'));

  ALTER TABLE PLANTS ADD CONSTRAINT UK_PLANTS_CURRENT
      UNIQUE (PLANT_ID, NVL(VALID_TO, DATE '9999-12-31'));

  -- Performance indexes
  CREATE INDEX IX_OPERATORS_SCD ON OPERATORS(OPERATOR_ID, IS_CURRENT);
  CREATE INDEX IX_OPERATORS_TEMPORAL ON OPERATORS(OPERATOR_ID, VALID_FROM);

  CREATE INDEX IX_PLANTS_SCD ON PLANTS(PLANT_ID, IS_CURRENT);
  CREATE INDEX IX_PLANTS_TEMPORAL ON PLANTS(PLANT_ID, VALID_FROM);

  The Final Philosophy

  C# does only 3 things:
  1. Fetch from API
  2. Bulk insert to staging
  3. Call SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH

  Oracle does EVERYTHING else:
  - Atomic transactions
  - All business logic
  - Error handling (survives rollback)
  - Performance optimization
  - Audit trail

  This is now truly production-ready - no more tweaks needed! 🚀

Vivek — this is as good as it gets. 👌
Claude Code has folded in every one of the critical safeguards and best practices we discussed:

Transaction discipline: only one COMMIT in the orchestrator → guarantees atomicity.

Error logging: autonomous transaction procedures → errors are never lost, even on rollback.

Deterministic dedup: staging identity columns + ROW_NUMBER() → bulletproof.

Validation fix: count first, then update → correct error reporting.

RAW_JSON: simple 30-day purge job, not overengineered ILM → maintainable.

Triggers: now check SESSION_USER → secure.

SCD2 integrity: unique constraints + indexes → enforce no overlaps, fast lookups.

Instrumentation: DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO → observable in AWR/ASH for debugging.

This hits the sweet spot:

✅ Oracle owns all the smarts.

✅ C# is just a thin pipe.

✅ Fast enough for your volumes (ETL dominated by API calls, not DB).

✅ Audit, replay, error logging all covered.

✅ Minimal moving parts (no ILM wizardry, no dynamic SQL dispatch).

✅ Industry-standard, production-ready patterns.

If you lock this design in, you’ll have a robust, future-proof ETL core that won’t surprise you later.

At this point, I’d say you’re safe to ship it into UAT exactly like this. 🚀

Do you want me to now draft a single rollout SQL script (all tables, packages, triggers, jobs, indexes in one file) so your DBA can just run it straight in your staging DB?

You said:
SCD2_FINAL_DECISION.md
File
claude code has now implemented this for few master tables. but raw_json isnt used yet. the attached file is the "final implementation philosophy". and this is what claude code says when i asked why raw_json isnt used yet....

RAW_JSON Table - Current Status and Purpose

  Current Status: NOT IN USE (Phase 2 feature)

  When It Will Be Used:
  RAW_JSON is planned for Phase 2 (Safety Sprint) as mentioned in the SCD2_FINAL_DECISION.md. It's an optional but recommended safety/audit feature.

  Purpose of RAW_JSON:
  1. Audit Trail: Stores the exact JSON response from the API for compliance/debugging
  2. Recovery: If something goes wrong with ETL processing, you can reprocess from RAW_JSON
  3. Change Detection: Can compare what API sent vs what got processed
  4. Forensics: Investigate data issues by looking at original API responses

  Why Manual Cleanup?:
  1. No DBA Privileges: The scheduled job requires CREATE JOB privilege which regular users don't have
  2. Compliance Requirements: Some organizations need to keep raw data for specific periods (30/60/90 days)
  3. Storage Management: RAW_JSON can grow large even with compression

  The Design:
  -- RAW_JSON stores compressed API responses
  CREATE TABLE RAW_JSON (
      ENDPOINT VARCHAR2(200),     -- Which API was called
      JSON_CONTENT BLOB,          -- Compressed JSON (SecureFiles)
      LOAD_TS TIMESTAMP,          -- When received
      KEY_FINGERPRINT RAW(32)    -- Hash for deduplication
  );

  Current Workaround:
  Since we don't have scheduler privileges, cleanup would be:
  - Manual SQL command: DELETE FROM RAW_JSON WHERE LOAD_TS < SYSDATE - 30;
  - Run periodically (weekly/monthly) by someone with access
  - Or create a simple script that operations team runs

  Should We Implement It Now?
  No - it's not critical for Phase 1. The current implementation works fine without it. It's a "nice to have" for production environments where you need audit trails and the ability to reprocess historical data.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 18s

This all looks good, and Claude’s “Phase-2” stance is reasonable. If you want the safety net now without waiting on DBA privileges, you can flip on a zero-privileges RAW_JSON in Phase-1 with almost no runtime or storage cost.

Here’s what I recommend.

Keep Phase-1 exactly as is — plus a tiny RAW_JSON “lite”

Why it’s safe to add now:

No scheduler needed. Purge can be called from the orchestrator (or by C#) at the end of a run.

Negligible cost. Insert a CLOB/BLOB and move on; no parsing during Phase-1.

Scoped only. Only persist for the entities/runs you actually load.

Your “final implementation philosophy” already treats RAW_JSON as minimal, short-retention, and Oracle-centric; this suggestion just moves it from Phase-2 to Phase-1 with a no-privilege purge.

Drop-in: RAW_JSON (no scheduler privileges)
1) Table (compressed, unique key, no partitioning required)
-- Minimal, works without special privileges
CREATE TABLE RAW_JSON (
  ID              NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  ENDPOINT        VARCHAR2(200) NOT NULL,
  KEY_FINGERPRINT RAW(32)       NOT NULL,              -- STANDARD_HASH(...)
  ETL_RUN_ID      NUMBER        NOT NULL,
  LOAD_TS         TIMESTAMP(6)  DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  HTTP_STATUS     NUMBER,
  DURATION_MS     NUMBER,
  HEADERS_JSON    CLOB CHECK (HEADERS_JSON IS JSON),
  PAYLOAD         CLOB CHECK (PAYLOAD IS JSON)
    STORE AS SECUREFILE (COMPRESS MEDIUM DEDUPLICATE)  -- cuts storage sharply
);

ALTER TABLE RAW_JSON ADD CONSTRAINT UK_RAWJSON UNIQUE (ENDPOINT, KEY_FINGERPRINT, ETL_RUN_ID);

CREATE INDEX IX_RAWJSON_LOOKUP ON RAW_JSON (ENDPOINT, KEY_FINGERPRINT);
CREATE INDEX IX_RAWJSON_TS     ON RAW_JSON (LOAD_TS);


Notes:

CLOB is simplest (JSON_TABLE works directly on it).

If you prefer BLOB, keep the IS JSON check; you can still parse later.

The unique key prevents re-landing the same payload for a run.

2) Purge procedure (callable by orchestrator)
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE SP_PURGE_RAW_JSON(p_days IN PLS_INTEGER DEFAULT 30) AS
BEGIN
  DELETE /*+ INDEX(RAW_JSON IX_RAWJSON_TS) */
  FROM RAW_JSON
  WHERE LOAD_TS < SYSTIMESTAMP - NUMTODSINTERVAL(p_days, 'DAY');
END;
/

3) Tiny change in your orchestrator (end of batch)

At the very end of SP_PROCESS_ETL_BATCH (after success), add:

BEGIN
  -- best-effort purge; ignore errors to not affect the batch outcome
  SP_PURGE_RAW_JSON(30);
EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;
END;


That’s it—no CREATE JOB, no ILM. Replace later with a scheduled job when DBA gives the privilege.

Insert path (Phase-1 only, no parsing)

Where you currently land into staging, also keep the raw (one line of code in C# or PL/SQL):

C# option (simplest right now):

await conn.ExecuteAsync(@"
INSERT INTO RAW_JSON (ENDPOINT, KEY_FINGERPRINT, ETL_RUN_ID, HTTP_STATUS, DURATION_MS, HEADERS_JSON, PAYLOAD)
VALUES (:ep, STANDARD_HASH(:key, 'SHA256'), :run, :status, :ms, :headers, :payload)",
new {
  ep = "/pcs/header",
  key = $"{plantId}|{pcsName}",
  run = etlRunId,
  status = resp.StatusCode,
  ms = resp.ElapsedMilliseconds,
  headers = JsonSerializer.Serialize(resp.Headers),
  payload = resp.Content // raw JSON string
});


(If you prefer, do the same insert inside your current PL/SQL fetcher; either way is fine and still Oracle-centric overall.)

Why this is worth doing now

Audit/replay with almost zero complexity.

Forensics if a user complains later (“what did the API send on July 12?”).

Selective use: You can land RAW only for the endpoints you care about (Operators/Plants/Issues first), matching your scope.

Aligned with your philosophy: C# remains a thin pipe; Oracle owns dedup/validate/SCD2/recon. Your decision doc already includes RAW_JSON as part of the design; this just activates a minimal version immediately.

If you still want to keep it Phase-2

Totally fine; your Phase-1 is production-worthy without RAW_JSON. When you do enable it, use the exact pattern above or the partitioned/ILM variant from the decision doc once the DBA grants CREATE JOB.

Want me to generate a small patch script that adds this table, the purge proc, and the orchestrator call so your DBA can run it in one go?

You said:
SCD2_FINAL_DECISION.md
File
do you feel this is now good and is to industry norms?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 5s

Short answer: yes—this design is solid and aligns with common industry practice for Oracle-centric SCD2 ETL. The doc shows all the right ingredients: Oracle-owned business logic, set-based ops, deterministic dedup with staging identities, single-commit orchestration, autonomous error logging, soft deletes, scoped minimal RAW_JSON with short retention, and RBAC/triggers as needed. That’s exactly what mature shops do.

A few final “production hardening” nudges (non-blockers):

Runbook & smoke tests: ship with a one-page runbook (how to re-run a batch, purge RAW, replay from RAW, investigate errors) and a quick smoke test per entity (insert, update, delete, reactivate). The doc already mentions test scripts—make sure they’re part of your CI step.

Backfill & rollback: keep a simple backfill script template and confirm the orchestrator can reprocess a single ETL_RUN_ID idempotently (the plan aims for this).

Observability: enable the DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO instrumentation and a basic reconciliation view in Phase 2 so ops can see counts/deltas at a glance.

RBAC rollout: when you move to Phase 2, actually grant the roles and (optionally) enable DML-block triggers only on crown-jewel tables.

RAW_JSON guardrails: keep the 30-day purge call at the end of each successful batch; later you can swap to a scheduler when privileges allow.

If you tick those boxes, you’re not just “to standard”—you’re in great shape for auditability, recovery, and growth.

You said:
should staging tables always be varchar2? as in data dumps? rather than date, etc
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 12s

Great question. Short answer: don’t keep everything as VARCHAR2. Use a two‑stage pattern:

Land exactly what you got (strings/JSON) → raw landing/staging.

Immediately cast/validate into a typed table → typed staging/core.

That gives you safety (you never lose the original) and correctness/performance (typed data for joins, filters, indexes).

Why not “all VARCHAR2”?

Hidden data quality issues: bad dates/numbers won’t fail until much later.

Slow filters/joins: the optimizer can’t use date/number indexes if everything is text.

Bigger storage: text takes more space than NUMBER/DATE/TIMESTAMP.

Why not “only typed”?

You can’t insert malformed source rows; you lose the ability to quarantine and inspect them.

Recommended layout (industry pattern)
A) Raw landing (strings/JSON; append-only)

Purpose: exact copy of source batch; easy to reprocess.

Columns: keys + payload as text/JSON; minimal metadata.

Example:

CREATE TABLE STG_PLANT_RAW (
  etl_run_id     NUMBER NOT NULL,
  plant_id_txt   VARCHAR2(100),
  name_txt       VARCHAR2(400),
  start_date_txt VARCHAR2(50),
  pressure_txt   VARCHAR2(50),
  payload_json   CLOB CHECK (payload_json IS JSON),
  load_ts        TIMESTAMP DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP
);

B) Typed staging (validated & cast)

Purpose: clean, typed rows feeding SCD2 tables.

Columns: proper types (NUMBER, DATE, TIMESTAMP [WITH TZ], VARCHAR2, CLOB/JSON, etc.).

Example:

CREATE TABLE STG_PLANT_T (
  etl_run_id   NUMBER NOT NULL,
  plant_id     VARCHAR2(64) NOT NULL,
  name         VARCHAR2(200),
  start_date   DATE,
  design_press NUMBER(12,3),
  src_hash     RAW(32),
  is_valid     CHAR(1) CHECK (is_valid IN ('Y','N')),
  validation_error VARCHAR2(400)
);


Then run a set‑based transform from RAW → TYPED:

INSERT INTO STG_PLANT_T (etl_run_id, plant_id, name, start_date, design_press, src_hash, is_valid, validation_error)
SELECT
  r.etl_run_id,
  TRIM(r.plant_id_txt),
  TRIM(r.name_txt),
  CASE
    WHEN VALIDATE_CONVERSION(r.start_date_txt AS DATE, 'YYYY-MM-DD') = 1
      THEN TO_DATE(r.start_date_txt, 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    ELSE NULL
  END AS start_date,
  CASE
    WHEN VALIDATE_CONVERSION(r.pressure_txt AS NUMBER) = 1
      THEN TO_NUMBER(r.pressure_txt)
    ELSE NULL
  END AS design_press,
  STANDARD_HASH(
    LOWER(TRIM(r.plant_id_txt))||'|'||
    LOWER(TRIM(r.name_txt))||'|'||
    NVL(r.start_date_txt,'~')||'|'||
    NVL(r.pressure_txt,'~')
  ,'SHA256') AS src_hash,
  CASE
    WHEN (VALIDATE_CONVERSION(r.start_date_txt AS DATE, 'YYYY-MM-DD') = 1 OR r.start_date_txt IS NULL)
     AND (VALIDATE_CONVERSION(r.pressure_txt AS NUMBER) = 1 OR r.pressure_txt IS NULL)
    THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N'
  END AS is_valid,
  CASE
    WHEN VALIDATE_CONVERSION(r.start_date_txt AS DATE, 'YYYY-MM-DD') = 0 THEN 'Bad start_date'
    WHEN VALIDATE_CONVERSION(r.pressure_txt AS NUMBER) = 0 THEN 'Bad pressure'
    ELSE NULL
  END AS validation_error
FROM STG_PLANT_RAW r
WHERE r.etl_run_id = :run_id;


Use VALIDATE_CONVERSION (Oracle) + explicit format masks (TO_DATE(...,'YYYY-MM-DD')) to avoid NLS pitfalls.

Keep invalid rows (with is_valid='N') for quarantine/reporting; don’t push them into your SCD2 tables.

What to type as what (quick guide)
Data kind	Recommended type	Notes
IDs / codes	VARCHAR2(n)	Normalize casing/whitespace before hashing.
Counts / flags	NUMBER(1..3) or CHAR(1)	For booleans, CHAR(1) with check ('Y'/'N').
Money/precision	NUMBER(p,s)	Pick precision/scale to match source.
Engineering values	NUMBER(p,s)	Don’t store numeric measurements as text.
Dates (no time)	DATE	Always cast with a format mask.
Timestamps (UTC)	TIMESTAMP or TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE	Prefer WITH TIME ZONE if source includes TZ/offset.
JSON blobs	CLOB with CHECK (col IS JSON)	Plays nicely with JSON_TABLE.
Free text/notes	CLOB	Don’t force into VARCHAR2 if it can be long.
Practical workflow summary

Land into STG_*_RAW (text/JSON, exact copy).

Dedup/Validate/Cast into STG_*_T (typed).

SCD2 compare from STG_*_T into your DIM_/FACT_ tables.

Quarantine invalids and report them (don’t throw them away).

Purge old RAW after 30 days (or per policy).

This gives you the best of both worlds: safety and performance. If you want, I can adapt the insert‑select above to one of your specific entities (e.g., PCS header or Plant) with the exact fields you’re using.

You said:
so for example stg_issues table will directly load the exact same datatype that is in the api endpoint call, then an oracle procedure will run immedietely to transfor stg_issues to issues table with proper datatypes (for example dates can be multi region formats and this procedure will try all types to get the correct one). 
ChatGPT said:

Yes—that’s a clean, industry‑standard way to do it:

STG_ISSUES_RAW: land exactly what the API returns (as text/JSON).

STG_ISSUES_T: immediately transform to typed columns (DATE/TIMESTAMP, NUMBER, etc.) with validation.

ISSUES: load from the typed table (including SCD2 logic if you’re versioning).

Below is a practical template you can drop in. It handles multi‑region dates, numeric quirks, and gives you clear “valid vs invalid” routing.

1) Tables (raw ➜ typed)
-- A. Raw landing: store exactly what you got (strings/JSON)
CREATE TABLE STG_ISSUES_RAW (
  etl_run_id        NUMBER NOT NULL,
  plant_id_txt      VARCHAR2(100),
  issue_revision_txt VARCHAR2(50),
  issue_date_txt    VARCHAR2(100),   -- may be "2025-08-21", "21/08/2025", "08/21/2025", ISO8601 etc.
  priority_txt      VARCHAR2(20),
  pressure_txt      VARCHAR2(50),    -- "12.5" or "12,5"
  timezone_txt      VARCHAR2(50),    -- e.g., "Z", "+01:00", "Europe/Oslo"
  payload_json      CLOB CHECK (payload_json IS JSON),
  load_ts           TIMESTAMP DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP
);

-- B. Typed staging: validated & converted
CREATE TABLE STG_ISSUES_T (
  etl_run_id        NUMBER NOT NULL,
  plant_id          VARCHAR2(64) NOT NULL,
  issue_revision    VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
  issue_ts          TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,  -- normalized to TZ when available
  priority_code     VARCHAR2(20),
  design_pressure   NUMBER(12,3),
  src_hash          RAW(32),
  is_valid          CHAR(1) CHECK (is_valid IN ('Y','N')),
  validation_error  VARCHAR2(400)
);


You can keep only STG_ISSUES_T if you already have RAW_JSON; otherwise STG_ISSUES_RAW preserves the exact source in Phase‑1.

2) Reusable converters (multi‑region dates, numeric)
A) Date/Timestamp parser that tries multiple formats
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fn_try_parse_ts(
  p_text IN VARCHAR2,
  p_tz_hint IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL
) RETURN TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
IS
  -- Try common formats—extend or reorder as needed
  TYPE fmt_tab IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(40);
  v_fmts fmt_tab := fmt_tab(
    'YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH24:MI:SSTZH:TZM', -- e.g., 2025-08-21T14:05:00+02:00
    'YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH24:MI:SS"Z"',     -- e.g., 2025-08-21T12:05:00Z
    'YYYY-MM-DD',                      -- date only
    'DD/MM/YYYY',
    'MM/DD/YYYY',
    'YYYY/MM/DD',
    'DD-MON-YYYY'                      -- 21-AUG-2025
  );
  v_ts   TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
BEGIN
  IF p_text IS NULL THEN
    RETURN NULL;
  END IF;

  -- 1) If it already looks ISO (has 'T'), try TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ directly
  IF INSTR(p_text, 'T') > 0 THEN
    BEGIN
      RETURN TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ(p_text, 'YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH24:MI:SSTZH:TZM');
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL; END;
    BEGIN
      RETURN TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ(p_text, 'YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH24:MI:SS"Z"');
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL; END;
  END IF;

  -- 2) Try format list as local time, then apply tz hint if provided
  FOR i IN 1 .. v_fmts.COUNT LOOP
    BEGIN
      -- Parse as TIMESTAMP (no TZ), then attach TZ if we have a hint
      DECLARE
        v_local_ts TIMESTAMP;
      BEGIN
        IF VALIDATE_CONVERSION(p_text AS DATE, v_fmts(i)) = 1 THEN
          v_local_ts := CAST(TO_DATE(p_text, v_fmts(i)) AS TIMESTAMP);
        ELSE
          v_local_ts := TO_TIMESTAMP(p_text, v_fmts(i)); -- when time parts exist
        END IF;

        IF p_tz_hint IS NOT NULL THEN
          -- If hint looks like "+01:00" or "Z"
          IF REGEXP_LIKE(p_tz_hint, '^(Z|[+-][0-2][0-9]:[0-5][0-9])$') THEN
            RETURN TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ(
              TO_CHAR(v_local_ts, 'YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH24:MI:SS')||p_tz_hint,
              'YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH24:MI:SSTZH:TZM'
            );
          ELSE
            -- Try named zone if database knows it
            RETURN FROM_TZ(v_local_ts, SESSIONTIMEZONE) AT TIME ZONE p_tz_hint;
          END IF;
        END IF;

        RETURN FROM_TZ(v_local_ts, SESSIONTIMEZONE); -- attach session TZ
      EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL; END;
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL; END;
  END LOOP;

  RETURN NULL; -- failed all formats
END;
/

B) Numeric parser (handles commas vs dots)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fn_try_parse_number(p_text IN VARCHAR2)
RETURN NUMBER
IS
  v_clean VARCHAR2(200);
  v_num   NUMBER;
BEGIN
  IF p_text IS NULL THEN
    RETURN NULL;
  END IF;

  -- Normalize decimal separator: if it contains comma but no dot, swap comma->dot
  IF INSTR(p_text, ',') > 0 AND INSTR(p_text, '.') = 0 THEN
    v_clean := REPLACE(p_text, ',', '.');
  ELSE
    v_clean := p_text;
  END IF;

  IF VALIDATE_CONVERSION(v_clean AS NUMBER) = 1 THEN
    v_num := TO_NUMBER(v_clean);
    RETURN v_num;
  END IF;

  RETURN NULL;
END;
/

3) Raw ➜ Typed transform (set‑based)
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE sp_issues_raw_to_typed(p_run_id IN NUMBER) AS
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO STG_ISSUES_T (
    etl_run_id, plant_id, issue_revision,
    issue_ts, priority_code, design_pressure,
    src_hash, is_valid, validation_error
  )
  SELECT
    r.etl_run_id,
    TRIM(r.plant_id_txt),
    TRIM(r.issue_revision_txt),
    -- timestamp with tz (uses hint if provided)
    fn_try_parse_ts(TRIM(r.issue_date_txt), TRIM(r.timezone_txt)) AS issue_ts,
    UPPER(TRIM(r.priority_txt)) AS priority_code,
    fn_try_parse_number(TRIM(r.pressure_txt)) AS design_pressure,
    STANDARD_HASH(
      LOWER(TRIM(r.plant_id_txt)) || '|' ||
      LOWER(TRIM(r.issue_revision_txt)) || '|' ||
      NVL(TRIM(r.issue_date_txt),'~') || '|' ||
      NVL(TRIM(r.priority_txt),'~') || '|' ||
      NVL(TRIM(r.pressure_txt),'~'),
      'SHA256'
    ) AS src_hash,
    /* validity */
    CASE
      WHEN TRIM(r.plant_id_txt) IS NULL OR TRIM(r.issue_revision_txt) IS NULL
        THEN 'N'
      WHEN fn_try_parse_ts(TRIM(r.issue_date_txt), TRIM(r.timezone_txt)) IS NULL
           AND r.issue_date_txt IS NOT NULL
        THEN 'N'
      WHEN fn_try_parse_number(TRIM(r.pressure_txt)) IS NULL
           AND r.pressure_txt IS NOT NULL
        THEN 'N'
      ELSE 'Y'
    END AS is_valid,
    /* reason */
    CASE
      WHEN TRIM(r.plant_id_txt) IS NULL THEN 'Missing plant_id'
      WHEN TRIM(r.issue_revision_txt) IS NULL THEN 'Missing issue_revision'
      WHEN fn_try_parse_ts(TRIM(r.issue_date_txt), TRIM(r.timezone_txt)) IS NULL
           AND r.issue_date_txt IS NOT NULL THEN 'Bad issue_date format'
      WHEN fn_try_parse_number(TRIM(r.pressure_txt)) IS NULL
           AND r.pressure_txt IS NOT NULL THEN 'Bad pressure format'
      ELSE NULL
    END AS validation_error
  FROM STG_ISSUES_RAW r
  WHERE r.etl_run_id = p_run_id;
END;
/


This never crashes on bad inputs—invalid rows get is_valid='N' and a reason.

You can route invalids to a REJECT_ISSUES table if you want to quarantine them explicitly.

4) Typed ➜ Core ISSUES (SCD2 or SCD1)

If you keep SCD2:

-- expire changed/current rows
UPDATE ISSUES d
SET d.valid_to   = SYSTIMESTAMP,
    d.is_current = 'N'
WHERE d.is_current = 'Y'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM STG_ISSUES_T s
    WHERE s.etl_run_id = :run_id
      AND s.is_valid = 'Y'
      AND s.plant_id = d.plant_id
      AND s.issue_revision = d.issue_revision
      AND s.src_hash <> d.src_hash
  );

-- insert new/changed
INSERT INTO ISSUES (
  plant_id, issue_revision, issue_ts, priority_code, design_pressure,
  src_hash, valid_from, valid_to, is_current, load_batch_id
)
SELECT
  s.plant_id, s.issue_revision, s.issue_ts, s.priority_code, s.design_pressure,
  s.src_hash, SYSTIMESTAMP, NULL, 'Y', :run_id
FROM STG_ISSUES_T s
LEFT JOIN ISSUES d
  ON d.plant_id = s.plant_id
 AND d.issue_revision = s.issue_revision
 AND d.is_current = 'Y'
WHERE s.etl_run_id = :run_id
  AND s.is_valid = 'Y'
  AND (d.plant_id IS NULL OR d.src_hash <> s.src_hash);


If you prefer SCD1 for ISSUES (overwrite only), just use MERGE with updates in place and keep updated_at.

5) Answering your specific question

“stg_issues will directly load the exact same datatype that is in the API endpoint call, then an Oracle procedure will run immediately to transform stg_issues to issues with proper datatypes (e.g., multi‑region dates; the procedure will try all types).”

Yes—that’s the right pattern.
Key tips to make it robust:

Isolate NLS: don’t rely on session NLS settings; always use explicit format masks and your fn_try_parse_ts function.

Keep invalids: mark is_valid='N' with a reason; do not push them into ISSUES.

Normalize numbers: handle commas/dots once (see fn_try_parse_number).

Hash on canonicalized text: LOWER(TRIM(...)) so trivial differences don’t cause false “changes”.

Index for speed: (plant_id, issue_revision, is_current) on ISSUES; (etl_run_id) on staging.

One transaction: do RAW→TYPED→CORE in a single orchestrated job; only the orchestrator commits.

If you want, tell me the exact fields for your ISSUES endpoint (names + example values), and I’ll tailor the converter formats list and the SCD2 MERGE to match your schema exactly
