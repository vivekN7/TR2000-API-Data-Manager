# RESUME - TR2000 ETL Project

## To Continue Work

**ðŸ“‹ Use @Ops\Setup\process-task-list-tr2k-etl.md to process @Ops\Setup\tasks-tr2k-etl.md**

That's it! Everything you need is in those two files:
- **process-task-list-tr2k-etl.md** - Contains all instructions, rules, and context
- **tasks-tr2k-etl.md** - Contains the actual task list to work through

## Current Status (2025-08-26)
- âœ… Tasks 1-6 Complete
- âœ… GUID architecture implemented and merged
- âœ… Cascade management system working
- ðŸ“‹ Next: Task 7 - Reference Tables
