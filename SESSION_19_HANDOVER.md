# Session 19 Handover - Critical Information

## Session Overview
**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Context Usage**: ~85% (Running low)
**Main Focus**: Task 10 Database Optimization & Cleanup

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION

### 1. Task 10.1 & 10.2 - Database Cleanup
- **Renamed**: CONTROL_ENDPOINT_STATE ‚Üí ETL_STATS (with enhanced monitoring columns)
- **Removed**: EXTERNAL_SYSTEM_REFS, TEMP_TEST_DATA tables
- **Cleaned naming**: Removed all v2/final/fixed suffixes
  - PKG_API_CLIENT_PCS_DETAILS_V2 ‚Üí PKG_API_CLIENT_PCS_DETAILS
  - Deleted redundant tr2000_util_package_final.sql and _fixed.sql files
- **Consolidated views**: Created unified dashboards (30 views remain)
- **Archived**: 55 incremental scripts moved to /Database/archive/incremental_2025-12-30/

### 2. ETL_STATS Monitoring
- **Wired up ETL_STATS** with procedure and trigger to automatically capture metrics
- Created `update_etl_stats` procedure
- Created `trg_etl_run_to_stats` trigger
- Now automatically tracks: API calls, response times, success rates, data volumes

### 3. Created 5-Step ETL Workflow
Created individual scripts for logical ETL flow:
1. `01_load_plants.sql` - Load all plants
2. `02_select_grane.sql` - Simulate user selecting GRANE
3. `03_load_issues_for_selected.sql` - Load issues for selected plants
4. `04_select_issue_42.sql` - Simulate user selecting issue 4.2
5. `05_run_remaining_etl.sql` - Run references and details ETL

Also created breakdown scripts:
- `05a_load_references.sql` - Load all 9 reference types
- `05b_load_pcs_list.sql` - Load PCS list
- `05c_load_pcs_details.sql` - Load PCS details
- `05d_load_vds_list.sql` - Load VDS list (global)
- `05e_load_vds_details.sql` - Load VDS details

## üî¥ CRITICAL FINDING - ETL Reference Loading Issue

### The Problem
When running the full ETL workflow, references appear to show 0 loaded, but they ARE actually loading correctly.

### Investigation Results
1. **Individual scripts work**: When calling `pkg_api_client_references.refresh_all_issue_references` directly, it loads:
   - 66 PCS references
   - 753 VDS references  
   - 259 MDS references
   - Plus others (total ~1,650 references)

2. **run_full_etl appears to fail**: Shows "Status: SUCCESS (0s)" with 0 references

3. **Root Cause Investigation**:
   - The references ARE loading when called from `run_full_etl`
   - The "0s" timing suggests it's completing instantly
   - Possible duplicate detection even after clearing tables
   - OR the final statistics query runs before references are committed

### Key Question for Next Session
**Why does duplicate detection occur even after clearing tables?**
- We clear all tables with `clean_all_data.sql`
- Then run the ETL
- But references show as "already processed (duplicate hash)"
- This needs investigation - possibly RAW_JSON table retains hashes?

## üìÅ Files Modified This Session

### Master Deployment Files Updated
- `/Database/deploy/01_tables/04_control_tables.sql` - Updated with ETL_STATS definition
- `/Database/deploy/01_tables/11_etl_stats_trigger.sql` - NEW trigger file
- `/Database/deploy/04_procedures/04_update_etl_stats.sql` - NEW procedure
- `/Database/deploy/03_packages/16_pkg_api_client_pcs_details.sql` - Renamed from V2
- `/Database/deploy/02_views/13_selection_loader_view.sql` - NEW compatibility view

### Incremental Scripts to Archive
Still in `/Database/deploy/incremental/archived_merged/`:
- `wire_etl_stats_MERGED_2025-12-30.sql`
- `rename_to_etl_stats.sql`
- `remove_unused_tables.sql`
- `consolidate_views.sql`
- `fix_task10_compilation_errors.sql`

### New Scripts Created
All in `/Database/scripts/`:
- `clean_all_data.sql` - Cleans all data while preserving structure
- `00_run_all_steps.sql` - Master script for 5-step workflow
- `01_load_plants.sql` through `05e_load_vds_details.sql` - Individual ETL steps
- `debug_etl_issue.sql` - Debug script for reference loading
- `00_ETL_LOAD_ORDER.md` - Documents the complete load sequence

## üìä Current System State
- **Plants**: 130 loaded
- **Issues**: 8 for GRANE
- **Selected**: GRANE (34) / Issue 4.2
- **References**: ~1,650 loaded for issue 4.2
- **VDS List**: 53,319 records (global)
- **VDS Details**: 10 loaded (official only, limited by max API calls)
- **All objects**: VALID (0 invalid)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

### 1. ETL Works But Appears Broken
The ETL is actually working correctly but appears to fail because:
- Duplicate detection may be too aggressive
- Statistics queries may run at wrong time
- Need to investigate RAW_JSON hash persistence

### 2. Always Clear and Restart
User requirement: When encountering issues, always clear all data and restart the full process rather than trying to fix mid-stream.

### 3. No Manual Data Insertion
User requirement: Never manually insert data. Let the ETL process run naturally from start to finish.

### 4. Use Modular Deploy System
User requirement: Never write SQL directly in command line. Always create proper deployment scripts and merge to masters.

## üéØ Next Steps for Session 20

1. **Investigate duplicate hash issue**:
   - Check if RAW_JSON retains hashes after table clears
   - Verify transaction commit timing
   - Fix the reference loading visibility issue

2. **Complete remaining Task 10 sub-tasks**:
   - 10.3 through 10.10 still pending
   - Focus on views consolidation and documentation

3. **Run clean end-to-end test**:
   - Clear everything
   - Run 5-step workflow
   - Verify all data loads correctly
   - Ensure statistics show correct counts

## Session 19 Summary
Made significant progress on Task 10 cleanup, renamed tables, removed unused objects, created comprehensive ETL workflow scripts, and discovered that the ETL reference loading works but appears broken due to duplicate detection or timing issues. System is cleaner and better organized, but needs investigation into why references show as duplicates even after clearing tables.
