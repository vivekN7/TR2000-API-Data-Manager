# Session 20 Handover - ETL Reference Loading Fixed

## Session Overview
**Date**: 2025-08-29
**Main Achievement**: Fixed ETL reference loading issue from Session 19
**Focus**: Debugging and fixing the ETL workflow scripts

## ‚úÖ MAJOR ISSUE RESOLVED - References Now Load Correctly!

### The Problem (from Session 19)
- References appeared to not load when running `run_full_etl`
- Showed "0s" timing with 0 references loaded
- But worked when called directly

### Root Cause Discovered
The individual step scripts (01_load_plants.sql, 02_select_grane.sql, etc.) all had `EXIT` statements that disconnected the SQL*Plus session between scripts in the master workflow.

### The Solution
1. Created `_no_exit` versions of all step scripts without EXIT statements
2. Updated `00_run_all_steps.sql` to use the no_exit versions
3. Archived the original scripts with EXIT to `/scripts/archived/with_exit_2025-12-30/`
4. Added comments to no_exit scripts explaining they don't disconnect

## ‚úÖ Additional Fixes Completed

### 1. Fixed SQL Syntax Errors in Steps 5b-5e
**Problem**: Scripts referenced non-existent `is_official` column
**Solution**: 
- Step 5b: Removed `is_official` references from PCS_LIST queries
- Step 5c: Changed to loop through PCS_REFERENCES directly for official revisions
- Step 5d: Fixed procedure name to `fetch_vds_list` (was `refresh_vds_list`)
- Step 5e: Changed to loop through VDS_REFERENCES directly for official revisions

### 2. Optimized VDS_LIST Loading
**Problem**: Loading 53,319 VDS records takes 20+ seconds and isn't needed for OFFICIAL_ONLY mode
**Solution**: Added check in Step 5d to skip VDS_LIST loading when VDS_LOADING_MODE = 'OFFICIAL_ONLY'
**Result**: Saves ~20 seconds per ETL run

### 3. Correct Implementation for OFFICIAL_ONLY Mode
**For PCS Details (Step 5c)**:
- Loop directly through PCS_REFERENCES (has plant_id, pcs_name, official_revision)
- Make API calls using official_revision from PCS_REFERENCES
- No need for joins or DISTINCT operations

**For VDS Details (Step 5e)**:
- Loop directly through VDS_REFERENCES (has vds_name, official_revision)
- Make API calls using official_revision from VDS_REFERENCES
- Skip VDS_LIST entirely in OFFICIAL_ONLY mode

## üìä Current System Performance

### ETL Workflow Now Loads:
- ‚úÖ 130 plants
- ‚úÖ 8 issues for GRANE
- ‚úÖ 1,650 references (66 PCS, 753 VDS, 259 MDS, 480 PIPE_ELEMENT, etc.)
- ‚úÖ 362 PCS list entries
- ‚úÖ 0 VDS list entries (skipped in OFFICIAL_ONLY mode - saves time)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 0 detail records (API calls commented out for testing)

### Timing Improvements:
- Full ETL completes in ~10 seconds (vs timing out before)
- VDS_LIST skip saves ~20 seconds when in OFFICIAL_ONLY mode

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### ETL_STATS Only Tracks 2 Operations
**Issue**: ETL_STATS table only has rows for 'plants' and 'issues'
**Cause**: Reference loading procedures don't create ETL_RUN_LOG entries
**Impact**: Reference and detail loading operations aren't tracked in stats
**Fix**: Would need to modify pkg_api_client_references to log to ETL_RUN_LOG

## üìÅ Files Modified This Session

### Scripts Updated:
- `/scripts/00_run_all_steps.sql` - Updated to use no_exit versions
- `/scripts/05b_load_pcs_list.sql` and `_no_exit.sql` - Removed is_official references
- `/scripts/05c_load_pcs_details.sql` and `_no_exit.sql` - Loop through PCS_REFERENCES
- `/scripts/05d_load_vds_list.sql` and `_no_exit.sql` - Fixed procedure name, added OFFICIAL_ONLY skip
- `/scripts/05e_load_vds_details.sql` and `_no_exit.sql` - Loop through VDS_REFERENCES

### Scripts Archived:
- All original scripts with EXIT moved to `/scripts/archived/with_exit_2025-12-30/`
- `/scripts/archived/05_run_remaining_etl_archived_2025-12-30.sql`

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Uncomment API calls** in Steps 5c and 5e to actually load detail data
2. **Test with real API calls** to verify detail loading works
3. **Consolidate scripts** as discussed - merge logic into master script except for:
   - Load plants (one-time initial load)
   - Load issues (for selected plants)
   - Select plants/issues (user selections)

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add ETL_RUN_LOG entries for reference loading to populate ETL_STATS
2. Consider adding PCS/VDS detail loading statistics
3. Add error handling for API timeouts in detail loading

## üí° Key Lessons Learned

1. **EXIT statements break script sequences** - Use no_exit versions for workflows
2. **Loop directly through REFERENCES tables** for official revisions - simpler and faster
3. **Skip unnecessary loads** - VDS_LIST not needed in OFFICIAL_ONLY mode
4. **Check actual table structures** - Don't assume columns exist (is_official issue)

## Session 20 Summary
Successfully resolved the reference loading issue from Session 19. The ETL workflow now runs end-to-end without errors, loading all references correctly. The solution was simpler than expected - just removing EXIT statements from sequential scripts. Additional optimizations were made to improve performance and fix SQL errors.

The system is now ready for the next phase of consolidating scripts and enabling actual API calls for detail loading.
